thank you for your patience .
dark dark . dark .
but the key thing is , ...
these changes are coming .
good day , all together .
here you see it now .
almost identical structure .
but it gets worse .
is that yours as well ?
put out the camera .
next , nuclear energy .
yeah . all right .
after just a journey there .
maybe some mutations will lead .
and so it was .
her family gathered together .
he always showed up here .
they were still fish .
and i &amp; apos ; ve always had them .
they called me up .
very frightening .
i swear to god .
why should we do that ?
fortunately , not , yes ?
and then they set it up .
be a mentor .
it feels great .
urban is lancet .
and then it became international .
i was devastated .
but i felt bad .
they really loved it .
the orange tractor .
... invent his own story .
so what &amp; apos ; s going on now ?
labo , slowly .
it &amp; apos ; s against justice .
we &amp; apos ; re a smaller brand .
here &amp; apos ; s the city .
first extension , second extension .
and then everybody went down .
he was very happy with him .
but it was very sad .
and that worked very well .
and it got even better .
the power can explode .
in china , it was different .
that &amp; apos ; s a great question .
my name is amain .
and it took 18 months .
just keep on going . a lot of fun .
and the answer to that is no .
okay , a few more .
there was remixer .
let &amp; apos ; s leave it alone .
so what happened years after that ?
am i going to like the color ?
but we need that overall .
we say in germany .
because that &amp; apos ; s what you can train .
what would it have to be done ?
i wanted to support them .
it showed up on the algae .
they want to feed the world ?
and why is that ?
yeah , here it is .
he had the experience .
there &amp; apos ; s an old study .
and here &amp; apos ; s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
some people have come and went .
who is the most successful one ?
these days are over .
privacy needs to be given .
they &amp; apos ; re selling certified .
these people make money .
there are online criminals .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
what creates the illusion ?
is it even photography ?
my gut feeling again .
he &amp; apos ; s my grandfather .
what happened here ?
how interested they are .
but you know what ?
the first is to limit .
can we change it ?
this is the last one .
what are media today ?
anybody see something ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
does it make you curious ?
you compare comparison .
an autistic student .
and i was an artist .
that &amp; apos ; s a wish .
rg : thank you .
why do we do that ?
because you know what ?
how do we know that ?
so it &amp; apos ; s true .
dk : 60,000 .
i mean the soul .
i &amp; apos ; m interested in all that .
that &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s going on .
robert gupta .
what did you do ?
there &amp; apos ; s no food .
can i be honest ?
sounds familiar , what ?
what was the result ?
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
i created one .
that &amp; apos ; s the exciting thing .
oh , so that .
a few more .
maybe 10 times .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
who are these relatives ?
thank you very much .
italy wins . yeah .
here &amp; apos ; s the video .
i was awe at awe .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
jk : both .
it keeps you fresh .
i don &amp; apos ; t think so .
isn &amp; apos ; t that overwhelming ?
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
and that &amp; apos ; s important .
but i kept working .
don &amp; apos ; t be disheartening .
yeah , that &amp; apos ; s it .
why is this happening at all ?
you see it immediately .
let &amp; apos ; s call him don &amp; apos ; t .
not very often happens .
it &amp; apos ; s not a country .
i have a question .
they use their hands .
there are two possibilities .
i think that &amp; apos ; s interesting .
that &amp; apos ; s very good .
somehow , it doesn &amp; apos ; t work .
what do you want to do ?
so let &amp; apos ; s see .
who will make it safe ?
players don &amp; apos ; t sit around .
i think that &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
i think that &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
i &amp; apos ; ll stop that .
let me tell you .
we &amp; apos ; re constantly hitting each other .
it &amp; apos ; s not toxic in there .
what is the soul ?
i &amp; apos ; ll go in here .
it might sound bad .
i can say anything .
play is not silly .
ooh , thank you .
they can go in .
i was facing him .
she secretly did that .
that would have been okay .
let me wrap up .
so how does that work ?
i thought about it .
what do these people need ?
i learned everything .
sleep is ubiquitous .
he actually collected fish .
i wonder .
so you can do that .
conflicts come from conflict .
so where do we go ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
here &amp; apos ; s an example .
so she was back .
and i kept working .
that &amp; apos ; s what happens to us today .
that &amp; apos ; s our present .
isn &amp; apos ; t that sad ?
we were 20 people .
that &amp; apos ; s the system .
the farm is incredible .
we need energy miracle .
that &amp; apos ; s great .
it &amp; apos ; s a crisis .
there &amp; apos ; s no normal one .
we can do that .
thank you very much .
they even hurt .
yeah , good day .
thank you for listening .
not school management .
there &amp; apos ; s nothing happening .
yeah , good day .
what a fish .
that &amp; apos ; s actually me .
what about longevity ?
they &amp; apos ; re all important .
it &amp; apos ; s generic .
so they meet al .
put it back on .
and she did .
i represent children .
what do you say ?
but the wrong thing .
the whole environmental debate .
yeah , milliseconds .
they have similar principles .
good work ! yes !
this happened at christmas .
just do your job .
i &amp; apos ; m a writer .
this was the result .
very expensive housing .
and he says ...
a few less .
that &amp; apos ; s us .
it has sensors .
after a week .
that was incredible .
thank you .
yeah . okay .
i was amazed .
are they all ?
hash .
we were poor .
centers were built .
that &amp; apos ; s not ...
solar technology is ...
we love innovation .
the sun goes up .
we love entertainment .
music as language .
gravel them .
come on .
completely inefficient .
it &amp; apos ; s an enormous challenge .
thank you .
not yet .
that &amp; apos ; s hard .
yeah , hello .
we know that .
because that &amp; apos ; s what singing .
you need time .
that &amp; apos ; s quick .
here it is .
not very sustainable .
ta ##AT##-##AT## da !
very different term .
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
that &amp; apos ; s wrong .
that &amp; apos ; s efficient .
it &amp; apos ; s awful .
it &amp; apos ; s essential .
that &amp; apos ; s scary .
i &amp; apos ; m tom .
thank you .
don &amp; apos ; t find out .
thank you very much .
a whole lot .
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
we lose them .
we take off .
fantastic , right ?
the only chance .
or in front of bombs .
there &amp; apos ; s no hospital .
it &amp; apos ; s interesting .
but it goes .
that was fascinating .
it works like this .
sounds good ?
i can help .
oh my god !
what does that mean ?
go home , where ?
oh my god .
long , yeah .
yeah , it &amp; apos ; s sort of like .
thank you . thank you .
three out of 10 .
is that reasonable ?
what does that mean ?
seriously .
it &amp; apos ; s incredibly exciting .
thank you .
thank you .
great trick ?
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
maybe not .
thank you .
thank you .
fine .
suck .
ol√© !
stephen watts .
thank you .
that &amp; apos ; s true .
that &amp; apos ; s it .
1.5 million .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it &amp; apos ; s about it alone .
one ?
thank you .
flying cat .
thank you .
thank you .
is that true ?
thank you .
thank you .
whoa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
hold twice .
well , yeah .
pretty simple .
positive .
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah ?
60,000 .
creativity .
yeah .
thank you .
okay .
fantastic .
yeah .
unique .
yeah ?
yeah ?
sustainable .
yeah ?
yeah ?
yeah ?
here &amp; apos ; s what happens .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ?
why ?
hi !
about that .
wow !
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
really .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah ?
yeah ?
yeah ?
yeah ?
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
what &amp; apos ; s going to take five milliseconds ?
meanwhile , the instruments have continued to evolve .
or take a lip pen .
tell them what they feel .
anyway , not to navigate .
but it &amp; apos ; s really , really effective , yes ?
the cause of writing it .
i hope you &amp; apos ; ll forgive me .
they &amp; apos ; ve literally reverse the levers .
this is an ecologist network .
i remember my first fire .
monday : color is a bit of a force .
just be who you are .
polite , they all applaud .
so , doesn &amp; apos ; t mean that optimistic .
that sounds , in principle , unusual .
the truth is more like this .
third , scale of expectations .
they &amp; apos ; re all about asking .
the official dobma of what ?
you can &amp; apos ; t do anything like that .
now look at this curve .
so scott gets this fruition .
he died , broken by history .
he went back to silence .
the white lines are for population .
you should want them .
i started my usual talk .
i &amp; apos ; m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &amp; apos ; s 2.3 million .
this may be public .
now we &amp; apos ; re doing this with airplanes .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
something very strange is happening here .
and that &amp; apos ; s nothing yet .
i thought anybody could do that .
i &amp; apos ; ve never met him personally .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
we &amp; apos ; ve gone into an area of danger .
he again showed him ja4 .
they basically do the same thing .
you see something fun here .
now , this is one of the images .
they &amp; apos ; re very good at it .
completely focused on a particular target .
this picture is from this place .
and then something funny happened .
i started an institute .
everybody &amp; apos ; s talking today about happiness .
that &amp; apos ; s cool , right ?
let &amp; apos ; s face it -- who &amp; apos ; s normal ?
so this crazy story could be true .
because here &amp; apos ; s somebody here , you know ?
and ecologically it was a disaster .
there &amp; apos ; s almost nothing left .
it &amp; apos ; s such a natural thing .
and we &amp; apos ; re very happy about that .
he &amp; apos ; s been up to about six .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
and we &amp; apos ; re too many .
it &amp; apos ; s very trivial .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
so the question is : how ?
a has these benefits and risk risks .
they &amp; apos ; re expanding five inches .
but there are two problems with this .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
she did it for three years .
let &amp; apos ; s talk about water wars .
and that was grandiose .
so what &amp; apos ; s the next step ?
sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
so i followed my gut feeling .
no , it had never been a chance .
the story is not over yet .
what happened that day ?
so we measured its movement .
they can be logical and intuitive .
she was back and dying .
and this video is real time .
the data wasn &amp; apos ; t available before .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
now , how did this happen ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can do that too .
they create a epic story .
it &amp; apos ; s a completely different term .
they didn &amp; apos ; t change the story .
if you burn coal , no .
and that &amp; apos ; s interesting to me .
they can play with different types of games .
the whole building was water .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like the most ?
happiness . fantastic !
and that &amp; apos ; s actually what he says .
and that got me so confused .
what should our testimony look like ?
it &amp; apos ; s a pretty crazy idea .
if you burn natural gas , no .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
a billion people are going to starve today .
that has to be the age of age .
so it &amp; apos ; s not like <unk> x .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the rocks are color ##AT##-##AT## coded .
people were still happy .
it was my first sunburn .
my name is brian goldman goldman .
she shares her experience with others .
but slowly it was very clear .
that &amp; apos ; s how nature works .
we all love baseball , right ?
we use the energy of the sun .
somehow , kids don &amp; apos ; t do it anymore .
that &amp; apos ; s about five feet long .
they &amp; apos ; re going to be in the open .
among them , other things shouldn &amp; apos ; t suffer .
that &amp; apos ; s why i made the movie .
it &amp; apos ; s just not technological .
and you already have a problem .
it automatically goes to the right thought .
emergency staff took all the strands .
okay , that &amp; apos ; s really what &amp; apos ; s really about courage .
and it was an incredible experience .
i don &amp; apos ; t take the same process .
and that doesn &amp; apos ; t tell us much .
we didn &amp; apos ; t write this app .
they didn &amp; apos ; t give up government .
that &amp; apos ; s it , it &amp; apos ; s easy .
here &amp; apos ; s a description of the street .
and then we did that .
it &amp; apos ; s to add experience .
this is ideology , not science .
let &amp; apos ; s make a small balance .
here &amp; apos ; s this little mechanism .
there he signed up .
i &amp; apos ; m going to show you that now .
no insurance can be built .
the students are divided into notes .
it &amp; apos ; s interested in fireflies .
i probably shouldn &amp; apos ; t .
we can &amp; apos ; t do that .
what are you trying to do ? &amp; quot ;
this is all metadata .
i got a little bit scared of technology .
there &amp; apos ; s also world record .
somehow , it doesn &amp; apos ; t work , right ?
i &amp; apos ; m going to stand for you .
i talked a lot about magic .
we don &amp; apos ; t go beyond that .
that wouldn &amp; apos ; t have been a problem at all .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
that &amp; apos ; s not necessarily a bad thing .
creativity somehow had to get out of it .
that &amp; apos ; s god , you know ?
let &amp; apos ; s start with sunday .
who doesn &amp; apos ; t want healthier kids ?
we &amp; apos ; ve reached a kind of balance .
and the shape plays a role .
so paul is a terrorist .
don &amp; apos ; t take anything for granted .
so that &amp; apos ; s the good news .
it can &amp; apos ; t be a problem .
it was just not invented yet .
otherwise , they can &amp; apos ; t have teeth .
that &amp; apos ; s usually not the route .
i think it &amp; apos ; s disgusting .
at the beginning , we just signed up .
today it &amp; apos ; s all easy to have .
the living people are the spirits .
once upon a time , we started a living .
in fact , we &amp; apos ; ve redefined poverty .
they &amp; apos ; re an inspirational personality .
it &amp; apos ; s not our burden .
my brother was staring at me .
who would ever wish ?
it &amp; apos ; s about blending sense .
we need to think about what brands are .
we won some prizes .
the morning , in front of the game .
but i don &amp; apos ; t buy anything new .
play is not just kids &amp; apos ; games .
no one &amp; apos ; s ever said that .
i mean , i &amp; apos ; m a journalist .
that &amp; apos ; s why it &amp; apos ; s a big challenge .
they &amp; apos ; re horrifying . &amp; quot ;
and of course , that &amp; apos ; s incredible .
okay , there &amp; apos ; s a few .
so basically , a translation of translation .
if it &amp; apos ; s the waste right now .
and it starts with a doctor .
and there are hundreds of them .
but that &amp; apos ; s not so fast .
well , then we want to .
who do you actually want to inform ?
they &amp; apos ; re actually bringing in funding .
i shouldn &amp; apos ; t say that .
i &amp; apos ; m shooting through my head a little bit .
so let me remind you .
everybody needs a goldberg glass .
something like that , you know .
what is this thing ?
give pee a chance .
nukes : yes ?
so there &amp; apos ; s two cycles .
have you ever been fatigue ?
and how did that feel ?
they could have done better than that .
my wife told me .
now there &amp; apos ; s a third sentence .
again , you &amp; apos ; ve got it again .
thank you for your attention .
2,500 to one , great .
so they saw something magical .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
i tried a little bit more exciting .
what is a story like ?
it &amp; apos ; s remote technology .
that &amp; apos ; s it .
wonderful , right ?
what about fitness ?
it sounds frightening .
what actually happened ?
it &amp; apos ; s also a very exciting phenomenon .
imagine mozart efficiently .
it really changed the dynamic .
and finally , epic meaning .
is this just education ?
what else is risky ?
hmmm , my brand ?
one place is south korea .
i don &amp; apos ; t have to worry .
lego made it possible for everyone .
they were drilling through each other .
we can recover our nutrients .
we &amp; apos ; ve built unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
these rivers are getting very rapid .
this picture reminded me of something .
that &amp; apos ; s a game out there .
for example , this perception in context .
anybody know what that is ?
we depend on two countries .
and that &amp; apos ; s what we &amp; apos ; re doing .
so the correlation is low .
the byproduct is clean water .
because to me , it means memory .
the mechanism comes from lie .
they always say , why ?
this will happen in the next april .
the chef had cooked it .
i almost never use it .
same thing , only bigger .
this is a dead turtle .
our magazines are read by millions .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
well , i was the next one .
and women argued that well .
the game begins -- silence .
they saw the big bang .
that was the beginning of the journey .
it &amp; apos ; s turning the engine off .
i really like nice clothing .
tell me about this world .
i see this plume sign .
think about your own decisions .
her mother moved her alone .
sometimes i urge too much .
they were genetically engineered .
that &amp; apos ; s more to the point .
this is what you see down there .
why not think about that ?
here &amp; apos ; s another example .
we &amp; apos ; re going through initiation rituals .
privacy is not a debate .
the only country in the world .
and this opens up a map .
that made me really sad .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
they come from artists .
it seemed quite popular .
i grew up in india .
what other brands are doing ?
you can see the water coming .
you can have this cloud .
and it &amp; apos ; s phosphorus .
every waste is nutrients .
that &amp; apos ; s what most people know .
and here &amp; apos ; s the representation again .
it was really , really , really profound .
we need to spread the message .
the data is constantly showing this .
shame . shame .
but it didn &amp; apos ; t .
that sounds crazy , right ?
will it have my size ?
it &amp; apos ; s very risky .
what do i look at ?
but what are we doing with this ?
my cousins were running all over the place .
we &amp; apos ; ve lost touch .
so , what does that mean ?
she connected these two people .
i lived in parallel worlds .
have you seen these guys ?
it has billions of them .
but they do the job .
i &amp; apos ; ll never forget it .
i &amp; apos ; ll never forget that .
it will touch you deeply .
crisis . death . disaster .
and a lot of people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
you always lose rare animals .
we have three main groups .
now , what does that mean ?
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
do you want jeans with holes ?
how do we actually work to people ?
he won &amp; apos ; t do that .
but where are we useful ?
the work of interpretations .
they were flying the canals .
but what do you eat ?
it &amp; apos ; s a lot of volume .
it was a huge success .
and then realizing it .
what do you think happened now ?
it &amp; apos ; s called paul offer .
it &amp; apos ; s not true of emotions .
the game is from 2007 .
i want to ask you something .
that &amp; apos ; s it . thank you .
we also call him don &amp; apos ; t .
i don &amp; apos ; t like that question .
it &amp; apos ; s been up all the time .
first , we have the population .
i had a good life .
this is the short term .
this is what the chart looked like .
and there &amp; apos ; s good news .
asked the nurse .
and fortunately , he did not die .
you also have to understand that .
it &amp; apos ; s getting more and more like that .
doesn &amp; apos ; t taste very well .
you don &amp; apos ; t want to do that ?
his name is temple .
it &amp; apos ; s prehistoric .
that &amp; apos ; s about it .
what else can we do ?
he &amp; apos ; s the guy on the left .
we cannot get rid of it .
they didn &amp; apos ; t have books .
they can &amp; apos ; t have bone .
today &amp; apos ; s project carriers .
they can &amp; apos ; t store energy .
i &amp; apos ; m going to finish .
maybe that &amp; apos ; s the reality .
so i went to the court .
once the judge saw me .
these things are logical .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we &amp; apos ; re no longer producing ourselves .
i don &amp; apos ; t think so .
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i wouldn &amp; apos ; t recommend it .
that &amp; apos ; s the memory of the basin .
this is feix .
it &amp; apos ; s not a protection .
because i can say anything .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
i just loved two .
what lessons have we learned ?
it has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
and that &amp; apos ; s pretty amazing .
i totally agree with you .
it would be heresy .
or is it possible ?
that &amp; apos ; s a great question .
here &amp; apos ; s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
but there &amp; apos ; s something else .
it &amp; apos ; s not our problem .
it &amp; apos ; s not our fight .
it would be intolerable .
my second mistake was worse .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
it &amp; apos ; s not documented .
they didn &amp; apos ; t have mass media .
so we &amp; apos ; re too many .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t have that soul .
i want to help you calm down .
so that &amp; apos ; s what the supermarket is .
so lickbits is open source .
but i started to ask myself these questions .
and that was what i felt .
then he whispered to me in the ear .
scott was subjected to man .
it may take until it &amp; apos ; s uploaded .
loans and sponsors were sought .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
now , this cartoon does a few things .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they &amp; apos ; re both survival , they &amp; apos ; re the light bulb .
i tried to preserve the body .
they divided the kingdom into two .
that &amp; apos ; s the truth . that &amp; apos ; s what i believe .
and there &amp; apos ; s plenty of employees .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
he had 20 minutes of glorious music .
that &amp; apos ; s how you feel good . &amp; quot ;
we now have makers in this country .
does anybody even know what that is ?
we &amp; apos ; ve set them up . puff .
we need to be spending more research on this .
the internet and services are a miracle .
my grandparents urged this number to 70 .
these were the first computations that were six years ago .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
so it &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; n . &amp; quot ;
saying to yourself , what is information ?
his whole process of work has changed .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
and this picture was taken by atlas .
they increase the paralysis , and they lower happiness .
they have them . they always have them .
we still think they &amp; apos ; re early .
it &amp; apos ; s about shifting norse .
they kept us inspired by this .
here &amp; apos ; s two different goggles .
i think that &amp; apos ; s really cool .
you can very easily zoom in and zoom out .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
the main man was greening me .
what do you think happens next ?
the corporate headquarters are right here .
he shook his head , no .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
a dairy , right .
this is a year &amp; apos ; s water flow .
they &amp; apos ; re going to make it worse .
we think of energy scarcity today .
and that &amp; apos ; s where jimmy km came .
the amount of water is larger .
so from the modern in the computer society .
you can dive into a particular year .
tell them , there &amp; apos ; s no previous failure .
there &amp; apos ; s almost no way around , pretty much .
but with the right design , please .
that is , we need to get phosphorus back .
we can support them to be good .
we can support them to be good .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
i see the dating site .
so what can we end up with ?
and that &amp; apos ; s what they do .
so , that was my primary motivation .
now i &amp; apos ; ll add a bathing to it .
we &amp; apos ; ve got to go a long way , and it &amp; apos ; s fast .
if you don &amp; apos ; t , someone else is squeking .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
they laughed more than they do here .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
living things are just about our lives .
the first one is a classic , apple .
i &amp; apos ; m a redundant person .
so again , that fit really well .
so that made sense , it fit together .
but how do you do that in practice ?
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
that &amp; apos ; s about one percent of the population .
it &amp; apos ; s just the test of survival and success .
uhh , wawww !
we get an absolutely flat line about that .
i would normally take the needle now .
well , i &amp; apos ; m going to show you .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
they run the process , they understand it .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
and then what do you do about waste ?
they &amp; apos ; re getting less rare because we catch them .
i have a nice example of that .
so don &amp; apos ; t save , avoid .
because that &amp; apos ; s what it &amp; apos ; s like to do , right ?
and there &amp; apos ; s a central part of it .
it &amp; apos ; s a new supply of america .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
in other spheres -- the world of communication .
it &amp; apos ; s not a decision between privacy and safety .
i have nothing to hide . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s not just a crazy idea .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it &amp; apos ; s the average performance of the bat .
yet we seem to be quite pleased with it .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
how do i get it away ? &amp; quot ;
life had not changed for centuries .
well , it was friday , that &amp; apos ; s right .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
i work in the solar technology industry .
how can we help you ? &amp; quot ;
and here &amp; apos ; s every piece that &amp; apos ; s very well planned .
but so many people have been given help over the years .
someone made an old ##AT##-##AT## fashioned version of it .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
eeeeo ! no , thank you .
tell me a little bit about this part .
you &amp; apos ; re going to tell me something about my brand .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
make it possible -- all of you here .
it &amp; apos ; s called the cloud -- the cloud .
this is how the building works .
so that &amp; apos ; s the reason for this project .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
tuesday : adaptability is being totally overrated .
thank you , danny cahman .
i was absolutely excited about science , you know .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
a lot of my colleagues are very young .
especially if he &amp; apos ; s already died .
it &amp; apos ; s not all to be <unk> able , of course .
there &amp; apos ; s every footprint that &amp; apos ; s going on .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
but you won &amp; apos ; t replace the phosphorus .
and we see that it does .
shake the environment , make less waste .
it &amp; apos ; s also a paradigm shift .
and they also feel their movements and their tendency .
it &amp; apos ; s just breathtaking .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
yeah . it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter .
now this level of intuition is very important .
the three words are , do you remember ?
i &amp; apos ; m happy i &amp; apos ; m there .
we &amp; apos ; ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
conditions of these species don &amp; apos ; t exist in us .
i call this the bright ones .
in words , what would you describe urban ?
the movie hasn &amp; apos ; t been delivered yet .
that &amp; apos ; s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
and i want to read them .
we &amp; apos ; ve done a lot of procedures .
do you want to come and listen ? &amp; quot ;
and nobody seems to rain about it .
as we think from the north .
but that doesn &amp; apos ; t have to be the end .
no , i mean it &amp; apos ; s really serious .
this is just an insurance method .
if that doesn &amp; apos ; t work , then what ?
what kind of action do i appeal to ?
we have something that doesn &amp; apos ; t go up .
it &amp; apos ; s the most powerful human trait .
and then he can walk away .
no , no , it doesn &amp; apos ; t .
asking , what &amp; apos ; s the right thing ?
i don &amp; apos ; t know who sees it .
this is where it makes the sun go .
we want something against the death penalty .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
i particularly picked it up here .
the question is , what &amp; apos ; s next ?
i tried to understand them .
it &amp; apos ; s easy , it &amp; apos ; s how it &amp; apos ; s going to come .
and that argument doesn &amp; apos ; t make sense .
if you haven &amp; apos ; t heard it yet .
they &amp; apos ; re gone . they are gone .
they don &amp; apos ; t spend time in power fighting .
i &amp; apos ; ll start with a few simple examples .
so growth rate is accelerating .
all of it is combuable of it .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
for energy , it occurred to me .
but i &amp; apos ; m going to ask you a question .
we don &amp; apos ; t like to talk about our story .
we don &amp; apos ; t really know very much about it .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
i &amp; apos ; m going to negotiate with the artist .
it all comes from our own pockets .
because we don &amp; apos ; t want to push around a gene ?
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of stuff that needs to come together .
and there &amp; apos ; s the storage problem .
do we really want to go this way ?
it turns out it &amp; apos ; s really difficult .
they &amp; apos ; ll be un<unk> able .
but what will come in the future ?
people suffered . people fought .
five million people use it every month .
daniel k<unk> man : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
i &amp; apos ; m holding the knife in my hand .
this has nothing to do with science .
we &amp; apos ; re talking about it later .
and that can make a huge difference .
you can see the timeline up there .
it &amp; apos ; s really cool . &amp; quot ;
i could draw . i could paint .
i &amp; apos ; ll stop , thank you very much .
now i see greg moon .
weathering ? i was totally confused .
they have the flow of water vice versa .
the assumption of maybe two percent .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
how far do you get there ?
so the first step into an interpretation .
if you come up , yes ?
and every morning i &amp; apos ; m going to leave you on that .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
in the third one , they tend to forget again .
maybe again , a little bit of a look .
i &amp; apos ; d like to give you a hint of that .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
so we damaged about 50 of these magnets .
but today we &amp; apos ; re far beyond that .
what do you do with certified credit ?
i thought i could integrate that .
it was a grouper .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
because we live on a water planet .
what &amp; apos ; s just been represented .
my fourth technology : the premise of complexity .
this is a picture of the object .
they want to orient in the museum ?
you walk around and you amuse yourself .
how would you describe your brand ?
a whole bowl of cool white food .
he can only use his eyes .
and that was the eruption of that .
but the truth is far away from it .
you can do it all the time .
the roof was also covered with water .
and why ? technologically , food changed .
a little bit went up to me .
all adults were aware of the risks .
even cats are looking at this video .
the third technology : categorization .
now we saw the reverse effect .
i like things that are different .
they brought their pictures , right ?
we &amp; apos ; re talking about bold , fresh .
i went to jail -- difficult .
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
i &amp; apos ; ll read you the entry .
so the first exciting primate .
we worked until late at night .
we reject genetically engineered food .
anyway , we need a solution .
it &amp; apos ; s sort of coated us .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
we also have very precise data .
yeah , that &amp; apos ; s the data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
do you know what &amp; apos ; s neatly ?
how did he feel ?
it makes leukemia for children .
she wasn &amp; apos ; t even drunk .
you can show me i was there .
anybody know what three seconds is ?
you &amp; apos ; ll see from the back to the front .
on the book and on the picture .
it was a pretty fond project .
the frozen ice is labeled with red .
seriously , the f<unk> !
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we started this 15 years ago .
and there are several reasons for this .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they tap into their internet connection .
we can reinvent everything again .
i &amp; apos ; m the new doctor .
alone , shame and no support .
why did i go to medicine ?
that i had written these crazy things .
i present people in death cells .
the silence is oversaic .
it can know where we are .
and these are the neural structures .
this is a modest little app .
but it has an unexpected twist .
the netherlands would have been too easy .
i get tired , like all of us .
and it &amp; apos ; s still not an interpretation .
so every concert is a different concert .
no tree is carbon neutral .
it &amp; apos ; s just a little bit less destruction .
that &amp; apos ; s what we call the &amp; quot ; mediocratic model . &amp; quot ;
this is my supermarket . no big one .
they &amp; apos ; re the home countries of somebody .
there can be a sequence of changes .
they gave her blood pressure .
and we continue to increase our expectations .
child mortality has reduced by a tenth of one .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
so it &amp; apos ; s right in the middle .
i think our identity is threatened .
these are the ap<unk> .
and that worked . applause for scott .
no one needs to give you the green light .
oh my god . oh my god .
here &amp; apos ; s her martian gang .
and i &amp; apos ; ve never seen you .
and it &amp; apos ; s also very risky .
it didn &amp; apos ; t make sense in my eyes .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
here you see roberto dancing .
this is a painting of a circle .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
and she &amp; apos ; s going to beat a 257 .
notice two things about this curve .
but perhaps that &amp; apos ; s not the case .
it &amp; apos ; s a very sensitive question .
we &amp; apos ; ve seen some fantastic presentations .
the storytelling needs more and more senses .
so there &amp; apos ; s a back ##AT##-##AT## up .
oh , my time is over ?
here &amp; apos ; s the olive oil .
well , that &amp; apos ; s not really right .
let &amp; apos ; s think about the atoms .
but reality is always unpredictable .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and you know what i learned ?
unfortunately , it &amp; apos ; s not much better .
so that &amp; apos ; s one and a billion player .
and that &amp; apos ; s a very simple question .
i step back to my sleeve .
it &amp; apos ; s kind of like a potato .
and everyone in this room has to go into it .
but there &amp; apos ; s another reason .
it should again contain the two elements .
that really solves the fuel problem .
the dosage also has a role .
who could have predicted all this ?
motors , powered -- four possibilities .
it &amp; apos ; s a thousand square miles .
but then they really want to go deep .
okay , you really want to know that ?
this is a child game , right ?
and i had to get away from the city .
and anyway , italy won at the end of it .
let &amp; apos ; s start with the sense .
we can give ourselves something like this .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
for a year , we had no cents .
and the goal here is quite simple .
the result was phase one .
not even the truth will be free .
and even lofen√© thinks about it .
moreover , these sources are intertwined .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
so that was a very strange experience .
i fell in love with this fish .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that &amp; apos ; s the beginning .
they &amp; apos ; re just better than reality .
so , look what happens .
so that &amp; apos ; s a hard thing to do .
this is like learning to speak .
that &amp; apos ; s just the minimum .
so you can &amp; apos ; t solve that .
so men can &amp; apos ; t be pigs .
people are talking about the urin .
and it &amp; apos ; s all packaging or content .
and the curiosity doesn &amp; apos ; t learn .
it &amp; apos ; s only got to process it as present .
that ecology is a global issue .
i mean , everybody &amp; apos ; s been eating pies .
it &amp; apos ; s longer than those other two networks .
a language is expression of the human mind .
bjorn sundin .
all of these things together are inevitable .
and that &amp; apos ; s the cd .
maybe i did it with some good reason .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
i learned this from my grandmother .
it &amp; apos ; s expanding fast .
the bank is from a different place .
her father died soon after she was born .
in the countries where people come to money .
that is , the ants weigh much more than us .
you saw it warm in the news .
... it &amp; apos ; s the crowdsourcing .
this is an idea worth spreading .
we called it the digital water pack .
anyway . i certainly want that .
and the answer is yes .
next week , it &amp; apos ; s on the market .
and i went back to work .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and try it again with another generation .
now we &amp; apos ; re going to do this with drilling and machines .
she had the last word in every family conflict .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
my uncle died of alcohol induced pluripotent diseases .
then i wonder : how did this happen ?
30 years ago , it would have been ridiculous .
i hired her , and i turned to treatment .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
so the theme of the day : money saving .
and that &amp; apos ; s what these brands have done .
so i think that &amp; apos ; s my brand .
in fact , no , it wasn &amp; apos ; t the mistake at all .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left , you see a little boat .
well , we presented the mayor of belgium .
so i think we need to be a leader .
i &amp; apos ; m not sure where we &amp; apos ; re going .
and that &amp; apos ; s actually a conservative estimate .
the faces of the audience were very serious and pay attention .
what happened is that we could do that .
it &amp; apos ; s got to go down to zero .
but the best one comes -- in a second .
here we are , and this is the painting .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
it was something we knew to do .
it &amp; apos ; s kind of like our fight .
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
how do you judge people based on their character ?
you expect another billion players in the next decade .
people in the side of the room are now coming in .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it &amp; apos ; s a complete denial of mistakes .
also , the energy price for you is very important .
and so i made a little bit of an unusual decision .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
it &amp; apos ; s hard to overestimate the destruction .
and that &amp; apos ; s where they feel .
picasso answers , wait a minute .
now everybody &amp; apos ; s trying to see something from this pattern .
now i &amp; apos ; m going to do a little bit of stuff about this .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
the question is , why do people accept it ?
if you generalize it , here &amp; apos ; s what happens .
and that &amp; apos ; s the planning behind stuxnet .
and we use this word with such contempt .
good night , sweet marshes . &amp; quot ;
thylacine ? yes . alive ? yap .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
the underwater part comes from a stone .
and i see the same process combine pictures .
is it about the details or the colors ?
i think maybe i &amp; apos ; ve heard more hands .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so each droplet was a little bit different .
imagine a soundless airplane .
sexual sexuality is happening in many different forms .
so they &amp; apos ; re going to go . they &amp; apos ; re saving the shoes .
we &amp; apos ; ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i mean , that &amp; apos ; s a real cognitive trap .
let me show you a little bit from near .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
they were just like the people in this room .
dip , roman , child paralysis .
there &amp; apos ; s a connection , a reciprocal respect .
we understood that the weather is global .
we don &amp; apos ; t want companies to patent life .
well , i understand . i do .
so my two passions were basically my two passions .
do you do that for the kids ? &amp; quot ;
every morning , they fly 40 miles to the farm .
no one &amp; apos ; s ever done that in the world .
there &amp; apos ; s very little talk about interpretation in the beginning .
it &amp; apos ; s such a tragic part .
it &amp; apos ; s all in it that &amp; apos ; s useful .
no , we &amp; apos ; re stuck with what &amp; apos ; s inside .
how can i make something as useful as i can ?
you know , science is not a company .
if your job is dancing , dance .
and they had to remove them , which is what we did .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
it turns out that dna synthesizing is very difficult .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to do ?
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
and it turns out to me a character in the book .
it &amp; apos ; s called verages and strange programs .
it also shows itself in other places of the book .
so it &amp; apos ; s supposed to come from the outside to the people .
i &amp; apos ; m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
so we &amp; apos ; ve got the technology to escape .
but that wasn &amp; apos ; t the end of the thylacine .
it hasn &amp; apos ; t come out in other countries .
i didn &amp; apos ; t want to go ; i love my life .
that &amp; apos ; s how they communicate -- that &amp; apos ; s how their fingers walk along .
and they &amp; apos ; re not just going to die of mat<unk> .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
and that &amp; apos ; s why it &amp; apos ; s not seen as a loss .
an amazing error rate . one out of nine .
here he lifts a rare glider .
this year , it was seen almost 50 million times .
it was seen almost 200 million times this year .
the rest of the time , they &amp; apos ; re delta .
just at precise points , they agree .
and that was an experience in humility to me .
now i &amp; apos ; m going to show you my favorite function .
it &amp; apos ; s the way i like to be .
the teachers didn &amp; apos ; t know that something was changed .
wouldn &amp; apos ; t it be nice to open your doors ?
there &amp; apos ; s somebody sitting in the back who didn &amp; apos ; t have a childhood .
this will be a key element of this condition .
yeah , they &amp; apos ; re right . we &amp; apos ; ll fix that .
another example is what we call virtual reality .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
we can continue these things in different ways .
and i went over and i just listened to it .
in fact , bear did not want to make a viral video .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
a lot of people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &amp; apos ; s all over here . it &amp; apos ; s all online .
i &amp; apos ; m very grateful for the catch here .
i said , &amp; quot ; what are you talking about ? &amp; quot ;
they don &amp; apos ; t talk about god and the nature of god .
today i &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
as a child , i used to draw comic books all the time .
but here &amp; apos ; s what you should have thought .
we don &amp; apos ; t feed identity ; we invent it .
that &amp; apos ; s what we &amp; apos ; re doing now .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we &amp; apos ; re more than that , we &amp; apos ; re citizens .
and what i &amp; apos ; m saying now is very important .
and we need to make a lot more difference in this device .
i &amp; apos ; m really sorry . is that crazy ?
my great ##AT##-##AT## grandgrandparents all died when they were 60 .
it &amp; apos ; s really old , and it &amp; apos ; s done .
do you know how to call it a 400,000 ##AT##-##AT## ter ?
i &amp; apos ; m an expert on relationships . &amp; quot ;
he &amp; apos ; s just deceiving you and not himself .
for example , for instance , the sanser , yes ?
but today we &amp; apos ; re just talking about biological systems .
there &amp; apos ; s no population problem with trees .
it would roll over the country .
yeah , i &amp; apos ; m afraid of all these things .
they &amp; apos ; re all back on their way again .
here &amp; apos ; s a few on the hamptons .
let &amp; apos ; s be kogi . &amp; quot ;
and of course , we all share the same adaptations .
these stupid movies don &amp; apos ; t bring us money .
and we &amp; apos ; ve also seen this in mobile phones .
there &amp; apos ; s a chance to do something .
and i have to say , there was power .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
at one point , the screen is filling up with leaves .
all of them were like this , they began to divide .
boston is not just a call center .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
after that , it &amp; apos ; s about the combination of different images .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
my mother suffered from the boat .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about wine .
what &amp; apos ; s the forage of food ? &amp; quot ;
well , that &amp; apos ; s great , we have a business model .
because without these liabilities , we can &amp; apos ; t live .
from the volgt age to the machine age .
now he &amp; apos ; s catching a tractor in the scene .
it &amp; apos ; s been a lot off , and i &amp; apos ; m in a hurry .
and it wasn &amp; apos ; t that hard to diagnose .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &amp; apos ; s also a very good reason for this .
and yet it &amp; apos ; s a realistic level .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about anything .
because it doesn &amp; apos ; t feel really money .
i mean , no one &amp; apos ; s ever seen a particle .
and it &amp; apos ; s not just about gender .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
i &amp; apos ; ll just say that &amp; apos ; s obvious .
that &amp; apos ; s a problem that many players have .
this player &amp; apos ; s about to be a epic victory .
we got rid of what didn &amp; apos ; t work .
it &amp; apos ; s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
but you know what they don &amp; apos ; t quite have ?
let &amp; apos ; s pretend we have a machine here .
that &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s built in the city .
my parents are 80 on the heel .
did you take all your vitamins this morning ?
what ? it really made me stop .
and let &amp; apos ; s start with an example .
maybe we can see witches as change .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would decide to have a good memory ?
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
imagine that for a moment .
second half time . end of normal play .
so you can feel the whole movement .
the flingos eat the shrimp .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
no apple &amp; apos ; s ever appealed to this .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
store those off , release the rest .
when i was thinking of it , he would have kidney stones .
that &amp; apos ; s alfred gonal .
let me show you how they work .
you &amp; apos ; re just listening , and then you &amp; apos ; re beginning to talk .
there are some that are much more spatial .
their problem is they have too little .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &amp; apos ; t poetry .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
logic doesn &amp; apos ; t matter what &amp; apos ; s true .
patrollers should still work .
technical cycles are the same .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
this is an incomplete development pattern .
what are the things that are actually archatic models ?
so , help me a little bit .
do you remember the windmill again ?
and then it usually looks like this .
so , that really blew my mind .
and they fly 40 miles every night .
we &amp; apos ; ve been wondering , and no one knew .
and we &amp; apos ; ve created an iphone app .
and the problem is not technology itself .
everyone in my neighborhood is gone .
it &amp; apos ; s new america . find out more .
new investments to create well ##AT##-##AT## paid jobs .
and you can continue the list .
and in this mind , memory was remembered .
now you &amp; apos ; re looking at the dating site .
schultz takes less energy .
can you play it in blue now ?
everybody knew your genius was a little laugh .
you come in for two reasons -- very simple .
my grandmother never forgot me about his life .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
and let me just give you a simple example .
the decline of dna was an interesting step .
we have access to exponential technology .
and i &amp; apos ; m going to give you feedback from my doctor .
i remember it was yesterday .
but these are all roads in the u.s. .
this is footage over a six seconds .
it &amp; apos ; s been huge in the control room .
and if not , don &amp; apos ; t forget your dance .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
i can change the sequence as it &amp; apos ; s happening .
i &amp; apos ; m looking forward to everybody &amp; apos ; s conversations .
anyway , they &amp; apos ; re doing it in there .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
that &amp; apos ; s mediated in china in a second .
and in my youth , i said expectation .
it &amp; apos ; s his personal imperative of seligence .
because artists have a dyslexic relationship to lie .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
well , what &amp; apos ; s the brand ?
attorney : i &amp; apos ; m a cattorney .
and that &amp; apos ; s great because we need that .
it &amp; apos ; s growing in winter and shrinking in summer .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is an interactive animator .
and the last two of them are also here today .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
you put a box like this .
our goal was to say , okay .
and over time , you can respond again .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
how will they feed the world ? &amp; quot ;
the shrimp is eating the phytoplan<unk> .
they moved to a natural concept .
so we have this horrible simplifying idea .
so two pairs , each one is a baby .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there seems to be an inversion .
well , the self is a storyteller .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
because they have special skills of the process .
i think the first one is curiosity .
i wasn &amp; apos ; t familiar with the labels .
it &amp; apos ; s all important opportunities . &amp; quot ;
there &amp; apos ; s another aspect of history .
this would be somebody who &amp; apos ; s completely intuitive .
and this is a million ##AT##-##AT## dollar company .
i never want to change anything in life .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what are you going to do with this ? &amp; quot ;
i want to show you something first .
they &amp; apos ; re in the back of our body .
we &amp; apos ; ll come back to these people later .
but the game is a shape ##AT##-##AT## shifting .
and of course , it made it click .
we &amp; apos ; re in the middle of this overpoint .
it can know how we hold it .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it seems to me that these two are important to unite .
i learned a few very simple things .
it &amp; apos ; s a decision between freedom and control .
but we begin to see a change .
i &amp; apos ; m going to try this through an unprecedented one .
because now you can apply a three sentence .
logic doesn &amp; apos ; t tell you about reality .
it &amp; apos ; s great , but i was in love .
instead , let &amp; apos ; s look at the ecological model .
the next step was happening within these communities .
it &amp; apos ; s cruel to millions of people .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
would you like to be more attractive and more self ##AT##-##AT## conscious ?
look at what she does .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
as an artist , i think the context is very important .
no , that was what i thought .
these things have a more positive effect .
he had uploaded lots of natural videos .
now , a lot of people have given up government .
that our contribution to the system is the vote .
so , it &amp; apos ; s here . right ?
that &amp; apos ; s the system that we live in .
i &amp; apos ; m a human . i make mistakes .
so you don &amp; apos ; t lose a lot of foreigners .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
it &amp; apos ; s a little virus that kills bacteria .
this is one , part of her .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
now , if you keep thinking a little bit further .
no , no , no , no .
there had never been a time like this .
and you know what ? they &amp; apos ; re wrong .
we don &amp; apos ; t want companies to own seeds .
there &amp; apos ; s a couple of really interesting developments .
so there &amp; apos ; s a nice little game dynamic .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
it slows down for none of our big problems .
that &amp; apos ; s the kind of teacher shame .
it supports other people &amp; apos ; s mistakes .
we &amp; apos ; ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it just didn &amp; apos ; t happen , you know ?
i want to tell you a little bit about this .
in two hours , it &amp; apos ; s expanding everywhere .
in this three ##AT##-##AT## sentence sentence , three sentences come in .
i was obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
it &amp; apos ; s got a button , right ?
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
it &amp; apos ; s going to offer a challenge to nine .
it &amp; apos ; s great that number goes up .
the last three of the five things i put together .
and i &amp; apos ; m saying that &amp; apos ; s good .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of great books on this topic .
and i &amp; apos ; m going to wrap that up for you for a second .
i said , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m going to listen . &amp; quot ;
and further , now you &amp; apos ; re always seeing him .
... could you just show the slide for a minute ?
come on , dance with me . thank you .
it &amp; apos ; s right , morality , patent stuff .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
you hope we don &amp; apos ; t need that .
you can predict . why is that ?
what does this look like ? pretty good .
i don &amp; apos ; t get that feedback in real life .
but it &amp; apos ; s definitely not an optimist .
but it &amp; apos ; s not just about the words .
we don &amp; apos ; t know exactly why this is happening .
but i &amp; apos ; m going to focus on the demo .
well , who &amp; apos ; s ready for this journey .
today i &amp; apos ; m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i said , &amp; quot ; promise , grandmother . &amp; quot ;
i said , &amp; quot ; ok , grandma . &amp; quot ;
but i didn &amp; apos ; t get tired of that .
he came up to me and hugged me .
it &amp; apos ; s connected by oxygen and silicon .
that &amp; apos ; s how you can &amp; apos ; t put them together wrong .
now let &amp; apos ; s pull out something else .
but that &amp; apos ; s what i &amp; apos ; ll talk about in a minute .
at the beginning , the tribal society , through language .
three sentence , you &amp; apos ; ll know from school .
i have to say , i don &amp; apos ; t understand .
thank you . i have a question for you .
players are master of the spiders of social nets .
this , by the way , is just the workcoat .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they get a model that comes from all over the world .
well , life itself lives on a continuous basis .
if it &amp; apos ; s no longer moving , you &amp; apos ; ve buried it .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
and if it doesn &amp; apos ; t , it does nothing .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
are you mindful , and you &amp; apos ; re like $ 1,000 ?
i always start with a skate , an idea .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chains .
we &amp; apos ; ve got to get ourselves into the machines of government .
so , if you could turn the lights back on , please .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
my grandfather was in prison during protest .
i think that &amp; apos ; s true for every human being on the planet .
the cost of solar energy in the last year was about 50 percent .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
blaise , that &amp; apos ; s really incredible . congratulations .
and the world that we live in now looks like this .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
you may have heard that we have watering signs .
so , don &amp; apos ; t worry about climate change .
that &amp; apos ; s exactly what i just described .
a baby needs about six feet in it .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
that &amp; apos ; s something that &amp; apos ; s lost in the first year half of its value .
and that &amp; apos ; s the little bit of the message .
&amp; quot ; the best in the industry . &amp; quot ;
i first ate it in a restaurant in southern spain .
so i &amp; apos ; m going to step back , and i &amp; apos ; m going to take a look .
the first one is that we &amp; apos ; re not going to go forward .
we have an abstract language .
welcome to fear . welcome the risk .
and his answer was yes .
wednesday night : embrace your inner child .
she didn &amp; apos ; t have the treatment of the brain damage .
so , go ahead and start to invent .
and of course , how design takes impact on perception .
so please listen when a music is played .
but for the lower two billion , it &amp; apos ; s a disaster .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
so you could feel comfortable selling it .
they did that by uniting the country .
and so my way of making films completely changed .
we run into the arms of placebo industry .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
play is the guy who holds us together .
but the thing that this picture represents is a problem .
man three : i &amp; apos ; m the shyp .
or are they more like a down toll ?
cats are looking at cats looking at this video .
politics doesn &amp; apos ; t change ; government is change .
i was a forced student .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
we rewired them , we repaired them .
but instead of getting in panic , he just stopped .
frostsy , the carbon man will clean every day .
then you &amp; apos ; ll notice that there &amp; apos ; s been a change .
there &amp; apos ; s only the second best , the fire department .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
and these were sort of the first people to develop tools .
by the end of march , the lhc will be able to function again .
i &amp; apos ; d rather continue to do this work that i love .
hey , puna , are you really serious ?
i &amp; apos ; m never going to play like this at this moment .
that was the very first early beginning of a musical expression .
and at all , you &amp; apos ; re working much less than me .
and then there &amp; apos ; s a whole lot of simulations .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
&amp; quot ; sustainable proteins &amp; quot ; he said .
they can dive into a decade .
it &amp; apos ; s renewables , as they &amp; apos ; re often called .
and you know what my answer to this is ?
i &amp; apos ; ll take this hand away . and here &amp; apos ; s the knife .
well , your life of self is not going to be happier .
and that &amp; apos ; s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
so i say , let &amp; apos ; s start the world &amp; apos ; s changing games .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty in biology .
bonobos are along with chimpanzees our closest living relatives .
and in the world , everything made a sense to me .
there are some places that we can turn to .
you know , we &amp; apos ; re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
it &amp; apos ; s really just about combining different realities .
secondly , photos should have the same lighting .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this is the call center for service and information .
most of them are completely ignored by the remember themselves .
someone had broken up , and had a hard time hacking the system .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &amp; quot ;
i mean , how much do we honor our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
if you have something , you &amp; apos ; ll give it now .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
they can move inside and do different kinds of experiences .
so they &amp; apos ; re moving around doing art installations like this .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
the pilot set out the machine after the hudson river .
i just wish i could see my children growing up .
here &amp; apos ; s a clip of this attack .
of course , this can &amp; apos ; t be done by a human machine leader .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
i went home through the emergency room .
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
the only problem was she had 10 children .
so in other words , i define what i want .
if one neighbor helps the other , we will strengthen our communities .
i &amp; apos ; m here to share my photography with you .
well , it turns out they &amp; apos ; re right .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
because the images made it real to them .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
that &amp; apos ; s the really cool part , it &amp; apos ; s called collections .
so what i &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about is really amazing .
i have it on my laptop here . &amp; quot ;
they knew it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that &amp; apos ; s not possible .
we want to eliminate mass extinctions . &amp; quot ;
i got in the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
and all the time , i collected more and more knowledge .
i studied printer , and she was in respiratory distress .
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
our steps at digitization of life were exponentially .
and all of a sudden , he no longer appeared to be human .
that &amp; apos ; s the time you fall in love with .
in fact , if we don &amp; apos ; t take phosphorus and we give it phosphorus .
he &amp; apos ; s got a food score from 15 to one .
but for a lot of people , that &amp; apos ; s a little too radical .
i &amp; apos ; m not part of this group . i have to say .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &amp; apos ; t work .
they need it , and we don &amp; apos ; t give it to them .
that constant feedback doesn &amp; apos ; t exist in real life .
this is moore &amp; apos ; s law over the last hundred years .
normal people aren &amp; apos ; t accessible to these devices . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s natural and it &amp; apos ; s just natural .
and then we offer one of these great dunes .
what &amp; apos ; s the next thing you want to talk about .
and i think there &amp; apos ; s almost a contradiction with this .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
and this video was actually already on january .
because that &amp; apos ; s where the real government is taking place .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
so we don &amp; apos ; t have a budget like other brands .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
i don &amp; apos ; t know who knows this picture .
isn &amp; apos ; t half a quarter or a quarter ? &amp; quot ;
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
1m is the highest thing i &amp; apos ; ve seen .
i thought we &amp; apos ; re going to bring the poker up .
it &amp; apos ; s an idiot debate . it has to stop .
but now you can &amp; apos ; t count my fingers , right ?
obviously , it &amp; apos ; s not going to fit into my little suitcase .
i &amp; apos ; m going to do it for you and then explain it .
you have to admit that that &amp; apos ; s a great choice .
i can &amp; apos ; t play the same way i did 20 years now .
you do something that &amp; apos ; s actually a little different .
and that &amp; apos ; s an economist . so it &amp; apos ; s logical .
it &amp; apos ; s not perfect , but it &amp; apos ; s much better .
even if you kill someone , it &amp; apos ; s not just a murderer .
and if possible , i &amp; apos ; ll find some of the weird things .
i &amp; apos ; m also going to resolve what &amp; apos ; s in there .
likewise , i think we &amp; apos ; re playing games today .
he said , &amp; quot ; in germany , there is no death penalty .
wr wants to help people convicted of innocent people .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
so when clamp says , there &amp; apos ; s no soul .
i &amp; apos ; ll give you an example of what i mean .
it &amp; apos ; s not just resource efficiency , it &amp; apos ; s efficiency .
that &amp; apos ; s star night , probably never seen before .
and i said , &amp; quot ; yeah , i love that . &amp; quot ;
just do that , and then you experience the sentence .
that shouldn &amp; apos ; t be a joke now , but it should be a joke .
you don &amp; apos ; t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
the main problem here is just like aids .
right now we &amp; apos ; re far away from this goal .
also , urban designers and farmer are very interested .
and yet , we don &amp; apos ; t really understand the possibilities of that yet .
maybe i didn &amp; apos ; t want to be the aid doctor .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
we &amp; apos ; re all born . we bring children to the world .
this is about 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
this , by the way , is the hardest part in my talk .
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
there &amp; apos ; s more to it , there &amp; apos ; s even more to it .
that &amp; apos ; s not how it works for the mind itself .
that &amp; apos ; s the problem i &amp; apos ; m trying to solve .
and then it was the same after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of places of human life .
since that time , we &amp; apos ; ve been given all sorts of recognition .
i didn &amp; apos ; t have to talk to the staff anymore .
what other metrics have you gone through ?
they don &amp; apos ; t even come out of the museums .
we &amp; apos ; re just silly around there , just like anybody else .
are they so far ? they look a little nervous .
she was barely breathing , and she was blue .
well , really good , maybe a <unk> star .
we &amp; apos ; ve just crossed the 7 ##AT##-##AT## billion ##AT##-##AT## dollar brand .
it &amp; apos ; s always been so inspiring , so it &amp; apos ; s so bright .
so these women met , and they just sat down .
i still remember it was yesterday .
but together , you can create something special like this .
i made the decision to go to the united states .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
by this airport alone , there is a range of 100 square kilometers .
we found that it &amp; apos ; s really weird .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they didn &amp; apos ; t want to have anything to do with the project .
how much money is needed to realize that ?
i shot in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i learned , in a moment , everything is different .
the dog ! i was a linguist .
evolution doesn &amp; apos ; t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
this is another view of the tree of life .
there are other pleasure , but that &amp; apos ; s dominance .
it &amp; apos ; s not about how happy a person lives .
life itself has no voice in that election .
and fortunately , there &amp; apos ; s also a whole lot of studies now .
we don &amp; apos ; t want to try to tell the future before .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
i think many of you in this room probably know this trick .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
it &amp; apos ; s really , really important that we get there .
so , climate change will become terrible for you .
we &amp; apos ; re talking about the flow of information flow .
a fish cap , but also a bird reserve .
&amp; quot ; yes , &amp; quot ; he said .
&amp; quot ; of course , &amp; quot ; i said .
we &amp; apos ; ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
natural light then offers smart grips .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
because in fact , this human being is not interested in evidence .
so , we can &amp; apos ; t even carry these things .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
he &amp; apos ; s only lived ninety years .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
how many doors does the house that you live in ?
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
the answer is no .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
yeah , so what &amp; apos ; s the need to be biohacking ?
well , chimps are known to be aggressive .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of happiness in coag .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services that we use .
and i talked to them to fund an expedition .
that &amp; apos ; s how the soul works .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
that is , the crime rates are coming back .
so , like a human being , it &amp; apos ; s all about things .
and now we can look at this .
this is what &amp; apos ; s happened in the geneva machine age .
the only thing they had was their head .
so we &amp; apos ; re going to start with a wingsuit .
so for him , they &amp; apos ; ve just been building blocks .
go and squawk cohen .
well , i went to the court .
and yet , there &amp; apos ; s this mental disruption .
it could take place within a time of learning framework .
here are the results that we just got .
as i said , amanda is wearing our elegance .
so just imagine two other small changes .
what would it be like to live longer with good health ?
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
we went back to the titanic .
<unk> ar is a certified <unk> ator .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and i took a while to figure that out .
the ones that make the scientific arguments are very little .
the u.s. drives the u.s. for hundreds of years .
in fact , progress is on energy progress .
but maybe you can still agree it .
to keep language , directly with the composer .
that &amp; apos ; s what it says , rather , the norm .
just as it used to happen in the village .
there &amp; apos ; s a political debate in our country .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
every big picture is the beginning of a snippet .
you see , dr. kean has changed his mind .
they shut them up to the beatles machine .
it was the misled permit for drugs .
a typical walmart will give you 100,000 products today .
they had 348 different types of marinade .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go into it .
you can see in all these museums there .
or are they a dead duck ?
i worked in a coal mining process -- dangerous .
think about it . this attack is generic .
in fact , it &amp; apos ; s much more dangerous and aggressive .
or they didn &amp; apos ; t have any foitomography .
a little bit more about them than they are .
that &amp; apos ; s the consequence that we have to confront .
these results have been achieved by hard work .
we don &amp; apos ; t want iran to build the bomb .
it was when italy won the football world cup .
they bring you to open your doors .
and then i &amp; apos ; m going to explain why i explain it .
so we &amp; apos ; re walking away , and where are we going ?
think about it . it &amp; apos ; s an incredible fact .
and yeah , i &amp; apos ; ll keep going again .
designing a phrase with its own breath .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
and what was that for you ? what did it succeed ?
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
here &amp; apos ; s another couple of people who test it .
but it &amp; apos ; s the sound of the clean coal technology .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
and everybody knew it worked like that , right ?
i may have another 40 years of work in me .
we &amp; apos ; re focusing on the fourth generation of fuels .
but don &amp; apos ; t always leave you with a bad thing .
and we invent as many times as we want .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and it &amp; apos ; s also deeply rooted in our lives .
there &amp; apos ; s a program that some of you may know .
edward cagava is a economist .
you wouldn &amp; apos ; t starve , and you know what ?
let &amp; apos ; s think about how we should measure our success .
i mean , you &amp; apos ; ve never seen anything like that .
he &amp; apos ; s a biologist at <unk> a palma .
and the question is , why don &amp; apos ; t you have them anymore ?
then i say heart failure , right ?
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .
saul coal , you &amp; apos ; ve heard a lot of it .
i could park right in front of my house . &amp; quot ;
54 percent of deaths happened through drill drilling .
in the future , most crime is going to play online .
race is the great legacy of humanity .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
that &amp; apos ; s great . here &amp; apos ; s the digital is the physical .
so he got the citizens to check them .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &amp; apos ; t do that .
it was totally out of the day that it could fail .
and that all leads to one big question .
i can &amp; apos ; t , but this guy can .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
it &amp; apos ; s not just a nice soundscape .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
it &amp; apos ; s virtual reality , without computers .
yeah , what kind of projects do we actually do now ?
like algae -- and other awful things .
and the world that we lived in looked like this .
i was shocked and crushed to the inner .
we have the passion of a young innovator .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
he invited the king of sidelity to dinner .
well , the energy price is over time .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
so how are we going to see urban in the movie ?
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that .
zdane , in a moment of head .
i have something here that i want to show you .
we see the same thing with the disability movement .
but will we do the best of our game drive ?
in other words , play is our adaptor .
he threw steel out of my consciousness every five .
how could it be that we do that ?
again , what potential do we want to do ?
we have the technology of the techno ##AT##-##AT## philanthropist .
it &amp; apos ; s a game called foldit .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
right , <unk> an , the judge has magic forces .
i gave some talks to the death penalty in germany .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
the cell communities began to radiate information again .
al is a fire hydrant in boston .
it &amp; apos ; s a puzzle that &amp; apos ; s still being put together .
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
we &amp; apos ; re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
she &amp; apos ; s a girl . she &amp; apos ; s raised as a girl .
and so , as he untamped , and he said , you know ?
it was summer , and i had shorts .
here &amp; apos ; s the current version of this .
the more money you deserve the less happy you are .
the biggest difference between them is dealing with time .
but one of them is significantly worse than the other .
... that the doings also play a role .
there were no cloning <unk> ons .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
rg : a breakthrough is the most important one .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
where is the biggest interest in getting this done ?
please join me , because the circle will end again .
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
i &amp; apos ; ve been looking for investors . i &amp; apos ; ve looked for new <unk> dors .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
so , as i ask , how competent , was this diagnosis ?
that means it &amp; apos ; s about efficiency , not efficiency .
and because we &amp; apos ; re getting older , the windows are getting bigger .
yeah , i &amp; apos ; m very happy to be with you .
that is , you &amp; apos ; re navigating sound about sound and rhythm .
so i know of some that didn &amp; apos ; t go into it .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
there , in my opinion , was a very good code .
it &amp; apos ; s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
clinical depression exploded in the last generation in the industrial world .
i just want to say a little bit about salvation .
a few years ago , i began to develop lip bits .
&amp; quot ; a pale blue . &amp; quot ;
she was a blackboards , strong woman , she had an effect .
so there are programs that can be sorted to the most adulterous numbers .
it &amp; apos ; s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
they were the biggest fear of piracy , rape and death .
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
all parties , all the <unk> tions of society , supported this .
there are a lot of stories about why we &amp; apos ; ve done this .
so quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects also feel the same .
it &amp; apos ; s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &amp; quot ;
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
it &amp; apos ; s about creating abundance of scarcity .
it &amp; apos ; s about understanding the nuances of language .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . egypt . syria .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
let &amp; apos ; s call it the animal ate , it costs a lot of money .
&amp; quot ; you didn &amp; apos ; t leave them . &amp; quot ;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
in the meantime , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
a remarkable , consistent brand . what &amp; apos ; s your brand ?
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
emc : &amp; quot ; welcome transparency . &amp; quot ;
and we &amp; apos ; re actually showing the whole process of how it works .

i &amp; apos ; m politically progressive , i distributed people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
you see , when you put transparency in google search , that &amp; apos ; s -- this is one of the first images that &amp; apos ; s appearing .
in a certain sense , it &amp; apos ; s almost like every atom out there becomes two , a sensor and a forger .
the conclusion from what i &amp; apos ; ve said here is that we really shouldn &amp; apos ; t think of happiness as a replacement for well ##AT##-##AT## being .
we &amp; apos ; re more likely to be at the symbolic level that we &amp; apos ; re concerned with as designers , of course .
and that opportunity came in , and the poem came in , and intact , on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first word .

quite simply , you go in -- and i created this , it &amp; apos ; s called the power of the zoid -- you can zoom in .
it &amp; apos ; s not a death when they melt ; it &amp; apos ; s not a end , it &amp; apos ; s an extension of their paths through the life cycle .
so that , as humans , if we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
it &amp; apos ; s a really easy way for bacteria to do so with a set of unintended consequences of unintended consequences .

and maybe we &amp; apos ; ll be able to see wits as something natural , coherent and useful and feel so disconnected from their presence .

it &amp; apos ; s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &amp; apos ; s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
she made me realize this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic avatars , and so your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
the other note is whether we use zero ##AT##-##AT## sumness technology , whether it &amp; apos ; s used in all the developed countries , and we &amp; apos ; re on the road to get it to the rest .
but i think , in this context here and with the intention of making a deception real thing , i &amp; apos ; m just going to leave the needle in there , and i &amp; apos ; m going to go from the stage .
but tomorrow can be the challenges for us -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we turn from the digital world to the physical ?

and in my view , the scientific method is to try things out , see if it works , if it doesn &amp; apos ; t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so if you take the system as i &amp; apos ; ve been taught , and all the faulty health scientists have done , then at the end of the system , no one &amp; apos ; s left .
and because we don &amp; apos ; t care about our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
and so far as isolation , as we colonize ourselves as a species , there will be isolating and giving changes of the environment that could produce evolution in a natural way .
not only from darwin &amp; apos ; s work , we know that the ability to survive , to flourish and to flourish , is determined by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflicts .
it &amp; apos ; s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &amp; apos ; ve been working on for as long as i &amp; apos ; ve been in advance .

most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this is , for example , a scan from the library of congress , and it &amp; apos ; s in a field of 300 megapixels .
rg : now we need one of these scaling , power generators , which is very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years using it .
i personally find that it &amp; apos ; s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &amp; apos ; t have to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that by using all this time to play , we actually change what we can do as humans .
i was talking to you , listen to this thing , you know , and i both know , if this book isn &amp; apos ; t brilliant , it &amp; apos ; s not completely my fault , right ?
and a lot of discussions that i &amp; apos ; ve had over the last six years are similar to the discussion that i &amp; apos ; ve been talking about in the last 30 years on photovoltaics .
because we usually have this new way of <unk> ability , which is the natural usurbanians , for example , five times faster on our goal .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit that comes from a distant , unknown source to the people -- for unknown , unknown reasons .
there &amp; apos ; s a life of self living in the present and knowing the present is able to see the past again , but it &amp; apos ; s basically the present .

it &amp; apos ; s this headphone connection that i believe is driving us , not just to be open to all the bright and exciting things , but also to the dark and problematic issues .
in fact , what you &amp; apos ; re looking at is objective , the first time you &amp; apos ; ve had more information than the second time , but i &amp; apos ; d like to guess you &amp; apos ; d find it in the second time .
and i used this graph to show you how valuable a country is at a place like new york , and remember that a surface in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed to something very true in human character .
if we don &amp; apos ; t treat a human being , and we don &amp; apos ; t recognize and perceive all the forces and possibilities , we can also create the natural struggle that you might need to lead to another disease .
my call to everybody who &amp; apos ; s flying today is : imagine the same thing happening on your flight -- don &amp; apos ; t , please -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
because , you know , i could imagine an creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &amp; apos ; t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
now , if you look at the extreme plans , the plans for the two fund , a subdivisive fund in the &amp; apos ; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
and the third one is concentrations , and that &amp; apos ; s the unfortunate fact that we can &amp; apos ; t think about a change in terms of well ##AT##-##AT## being without distorting its meaning .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &amp; apos ; re designed and i &amp; apos ; m developing like boat rockets to send the genetic questions into the next level of orbit to drop into the sea .
telephone , computer videos , video ads , cd ##AT##-##AT## roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to have this information .
the little warhead takes over a cassava , and then it rotates the rotors , and it slows them down , and the big warheads come up with six cascades in interaction , and it &amp; apos ; s manipulated .
now , with archaebacteria , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but we &amp; apos ; ve just recently shown that you can do a whole chromosome from one chromosome to another , and you can activate it .
uselty always means how to reach a certain amount of goal , or how to reach a user in a particular useful context , efficiently and satisfying a goal .
they created a 11,000 hectares of fish -- bark , sea turtles , shrimp , al qaeda -- and in doing so , miguel and his company completely reversed the environmental destruction .
so when i knew i was coming here to look at the world of industries and sponsoring , i knew i was going to do something a little bit different .
maybe the current concept , which is just paying attention to what &amp; apos ; s broken in one , and how we fix this , for every single one of these larger disability than the pathology .
what &amp; apos ; s happening is , obviously , money doesn &amp; apos ; t create an experience of experience , but lack of money makes sure that money makes you miserable , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
so an interesting consequence of the interactions that we began to see is that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like colors like this to how to do with liquid liquidity .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disability i had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying , you know , it can describe me with these definitions .
and then i got to berlin in the middle of the &amp; apos ; 80s , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and it wasn &amp; apos ; t &amp; apos ; in karate .
that is , if we look at the fact that we can transmit existing models from one thing to another , for example , the metaphor , then i can use it as a designer .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just objects that are made together in a small room .
the nice thing about this island is that you can basically take everything away from problems that we &amp; apos ; re going to get if we want to increase our share of renewables .
you can see who we were , and how life shaped us , and now we can see that the men who might have come to our lives would have come to be more aware of us .
it &amp; apos ; s a river that leads to all the things that are happening today , from rivers that tend to cause them to lead , chemical pollutants , from pedapest forces .
i live on building computers , and i know that i couldn &amp; apos ; t use the mechanism that i use to build computers without the last ever made any progress in computer technology .
i got my father until he finally got a dive in buffo school in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
and if that air is going to come over the people , it &amp; apos ; s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t make any difference . it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we think , what we see , what we believe , what makes us feel real .
the terrain &amp; apos ; s gravity concept means instead of a part of the urbanist , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
i used to sell this as &amp; quot ; romeo and julia on a ship &amp; quot ; -- it became a love movie for epic . it was a passionate movie .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixck beer with my sister and i went to the forest .
and it &amp; apos ; s probably pretty much where the toughest representatives of the street scene are going to be -- banky , shehay fafatirey , casinos -- all these guys will be there .
it &amp; apos ; s because you &amp; apos ; re very short of a cost and funded just the learning curve , and i think we should try and do more things that have the potential to be much less expensive .
and what &amp; apos ; s so frustrating and frustrating is , steve levitt told you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install car seats , and it &amp; apos ; s a waste of money .
a lot of journalists called me the question : &amp; quot ; what are you going to do that tell us if caster semenya is female or male ? &amp; quot ;
in both of them , it &amp; apos ; s too late to start trying to figure out if they can &amp; apos ; t do it , or to learn how to use these little muscles that use the vocal chords , right ?
i understand you right ? your software allows you to have a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are being used by someone in the world are basically connected together .
and it &amp; apos ; s extremely likely that everything i &amp; apos ; m going to write about now is being judged by the world as the work that came after my last book , right ?
as we keep pushing our science forward , we &amp; apos ; re getting increasingly into a zone of uncomfortable where we need to acknowledge that the simple categories that we &amp; apos ; ve probably had are so simple .
over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and said , &amp; quot ; no , because they didn &amp; apos ; t want to be part of the project .
and it wasn &amp; apos ; t until he was 19 years old that he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was emitting that the doctors found that he was inside .
what &amp; apos ; s interesting here is that this slide , like a manhole , which we often find buried in our field , is a kind of a seismic curve .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us a dream in his &amp; quot ; i have a kind of solution . &amp; quot ;
so if transportation technology continued as fast as the microprocess technology , then we could get over the morning into a taxi , and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
after all , a society is not measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privileged people , but how they deal with the poor , the judgment that they have .
there &amp; apos ; s an enormous amount of prescription marketing for people like you and me , if you think about it , doesn &amp; apos ; t make any sense , because we don &amp; apos ; t buy them .

the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , was the swiss bank account of mr. sam jajasper in here , and in this account , 149 million u.s. dollars , when it was frozen .
so somehow , i &amp; apos ; ve got to find a way of writing a safe distance between myself and my very natural comfort about how the reaction will be written .
that &amp; apos ; s why i prefer to do the whole thing in german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be important for me to translate translation into translation .
in other words , they found a way in this spirit , evolutionary way , that allowed them to write down the decline of what they were able to be stored and copied that information .
and i was confused because i thought the whole idea of advertising was to present your product to as many people as possible , as many people as possible .
18 months ago , i did something else about google , and i resigned myself to do something with museums and art , and my chute , which is also today , gave me the green light .
we see many , many gigabits of digital photographs here , that you can get close and further as soon as you go up , throw in , in a way , new way .
so to buy new jeans after many years of tracing the tracker , and i said , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; d like to have a few jeans here , here &amp; apos ; s my size . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study nis ##AT##-##AT## happiness , or whether they want to explore life review , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
let &amp; apos ; s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less comfortable with what i &amp; apos ; ve talked to you about .
and there was another nurse , not the nurse who had seen her after a woman printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear the most emergency doctors i know .
and even though they &amp; apos ; re all shut down , every minute we look at our child being mutilated as a football game , we also ask ourselves , &amp; quot ; should i accept this call ?
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &amp; apos ; s a lot of people who would like to live there .
and there &amp; apos ; s a generation that &amp; apos ; s grown up on the internet , and it knows that it &amp; apos ; s not so hard to do things together that you just have to build properly systems .
i didn &amp; apos ; t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &amp; apos ; t like fish , i don &amp; apos ; t like it . i don &amp; apos ; t like it . i don &amp; apos ; t like it .
there &amp; apos ; s also some sort of denial about whether you learn it for your home use , only passively understands or you can actively talk to your musical language .
i want to end with a poem written by a persian poet named adiz in the 1400s , who told me my friend jacques bois , and the poem is called , &amp; quot ; god , who knows only four words . &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; every god knows the god , not the name of god , but the god who knows only four words , and he says , &amp; quot ; come on with me , &amp; quot ; dance . &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; m going to leave my final words to an english scientist , hueyeley davey davey , who , as i suspect , confessed the useless experiments of his apprentice , his apprentice was michael farady , who said , &amp; quot ; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind when our scientific imagination is last , that there &amp; apos ; s no mystery in nature that our triumph , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &amp; quot ;
in my show , &amp; quot ; white cottage , black way . &amp; quot ; i have the habit of saying , &amp; quot ; this is my bad mistake , &amp; quot ; i would like to say to each of the rescue failures of the rescue to the farmed , &amp; quot ; this is my worse mistake , &amp; quot ; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , what about your microphone , and then i &amp; apos ; ll show you the microphone .

one of them is that , through the great selection of various saltwists , if you buy one , and it &amp; apos ; s not perfect -- and what salesce is already perfect ? it &amp; apos ; s easy to imagine that you could have made a different decision that would have been better . and what has happened is this image of this image that made you regret , and that &amp; apos ; s the negative decision , and that &amp; apos ; s the negative regrets of your happiness that you made from your decision , even if it was a good decision .
what i found really extraordinary was that he had collected paper clips of my entire childhood , and he used these cuts to a letter competition in the second grade , whether i &amp; apos ; d won with the parentage of parchment in the paratrooper , whether i &amp; apos ; d had my fellowship or a fellowship in my sport , and he used these cuts to teach his students how to teach medical school students from the pediatrician boy and the school , hey .
at this point , jajavio said , &amp; quot ; what happens when we take an uncanny area of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- a part of the american embassy &amp; apos ; s message -- and then people want to work under the canadian rules or the united states or the united states , they can work there , and they can do all these messages in this area that they usually have to go to canada or america ? &amp; quot ;
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &amp; apos ; re suddenly taken out of your life one day and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you see a sunrise . and in this crystallization moment of the first light , when the sun begins to shine on the beautiful landscape , all of a sudden you &amp; apos ; ve learned in the abstract glory . and the priest comes back and says , &amp; quot ; you see it &amp; apos ; s really ? i told you how i &amp; apos ; ve told you .
and if you &amp; apos ; ve got people who are vulnerable to the belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they &amp; apos ; ve been resurrected from the soul to life , they think that it &amp; apos ; s kind of like the soul is such a hovering framework for them , not just from matter , but from themselves and blood , something that , in a way , is to the earth , to the untapped , untapped , meaningful , insignificant .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness of women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connected to a four ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old girl &amp; apos ; s lives , when she was talking to her little sister , her mother and grandmother for five days and nights , sitting together in a small boat in the chinese ocean , and a connectedness of this little girl &amp; apos ; s life , and she never disappeared -- this little girl who now lives in san francisco and is talking to you today ?
and we &amp; apos ; re going to take a series of trips to the ethnicity on which we can take our audiences to places of such cultural wonders that they &amp; apos ; re going to be accomplished by the foreigners , and hopefully , one after the other , they &amp; apos ; ll assume the central revelation of anthropology : that this world has earned it to exist in different ways that we can find a way of living in a truly multicultural heritage world where the wisdom of all of our people can contribute to our common well ##AT##-##AT## being .
so , i &amp; apos ; d like to sum up my talk once , and that is that the characteristics and the skills that we &amp; apos ; ve acquired from the void age , and that &amp; apos ; s kind of a little bit of a mess we &amp; apos ; ve come up with in the machine age that can be re ##AT##-##AT## activated with what we call the cymatics age , and that in this way , we &amp; apos ; re doing this complex , technological products , not actually come back to the future , but we &amp; apos ; re coming back to our roots .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- along with my science adviser patricelli and my colleague at evan kinei , i began to wonder : what if we use computers , which , instead of a mouse cursor that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface ... what if we could intervene with both hands and physically reach the data and physically reach it , how would we like ?
now , when someone has been trying to do this , and they &amp; apos ; re all very adept , and they &amp; apos ; re telling who they &amp; apos ; re all , my photo of the notre cathedral suddenly , with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this room , in these metastases that use photos of other people , and so it &amp; apos ; s a kind of an interstate of social experience of using other people .
when you come back to shore and you say , &amp; quot ; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound glass , the sound weakened , and the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human capacity , if you &amp; apos ; re working on the sea , &amp; quot ; you can &amp; apos ; t explain that to others . that &amp; apos ; s just like police officers or soldiers who &amp; apos ; ve done something together , and they know they can never explain it .
the young acrylic will be taken from the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shakeable world of fins , in stone beds of the glaciers &amp; apos ; sleep for 18 years . two periods of time , they &amp; apos ; re currently elected to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spent in their body &amp; apos ; s lap , they &amp; apos ; re now spending metamorphoid of the great mother &amp; apos ; s lap .
now we &amp; apos ; re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where denizen foreign service uses like gmail , because you know that they &amp; apos ; re able to trust more than local officials , and they &amp; apos ; re encrypted across the chain so that the local government can &amp; apos ; t walk around in their conversation .
many of you will be familiar with the story because of steves , a book later on was filmed again with robert down junior , when steve lopez and jamie <unk> x was the master of malayy ayson , the double reunion , who was at the juilliard consin consin , and whose promising career was finally finished by his paranoid schizophrenia .
i even talked to my professor , richard evan shullt , the man who &amp; apos ; s running the psychedelic branches with the discovery of magical mushrooms in mexico in the 30,000 years , talking about it . i argued that you couldn &amp; apos ; t interfere with this trending tamines because at the moment you feel the effects you &amp; apos ; re not there anymore to experience a hallucination .
for example , women who were using the voting right , the idea of founding fathers , which says that anemia is more important than the anatomical difference , and they said , &amp; quot ; that we have a uterus and an iron hives , and we don &amp; apos ; t have a difference , that we shouldn &amp; apos ; t have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to own citizenship , etc . &amp; quot ;
there &amp; apos ; s not a lot of space to be aware of in the malaria population of assassinated by assassination or cold winds of tibet , but they &amp; apos ; ve yet , through time and ritual , they &amp; apos ; ve formed a mysterious bus that &amp; apos ; s not based on the idea that they &amp; apos ; re deeply aware of , but in a far subtle way , the idea that the earth can exist only because it &amp; apos ; s breathe into human consciousness .
a huge success story , but again , we have the problem of a growing company , and then we have two thousand , a small group , decided that we &amp; apos ; re going to start small again and go back and do the next topic of the future , and that &amp; apos ; s called , i think , is crazy again , so again , that people say , what the nonsense is all that we &amp; apos ; re talking about , we &amp; apos ; re talking about .
so that the system can develop backups that make it easier for people to feel inevitable , and it also also enables people to create supportive spaces where anyone who is watching health care can actually address things that are potential and actually respond to it , and it &amp; apos ; s even rewarded for it , and it &amp; apos ; s particularly people like me , who are making mistakes and should be rewarded for the benefits of these errors .
now , if you &amp; apos ; re one of those who doesn &amp; apos ; t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch off your listening , take your personal communication device -- i &amp; apos ; ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can look at kathryn &amp; apos ; s book , which is to be wrong , because nothing else will make any sense of it .
it &amp; apos ; s &amp; apos ; fridays , fridays . god forbid we &amp; apos ; d have this conversation on fridays . everybody &amp; apos ; s lobody loren &amp; apos ; s looping to the goose , to the goose , to the goose . &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; lunch . &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; i don &amp; apos ; t think we &amp; apos ; d run this conversation without talking about this video .
i &amp; apos ; d like to show you a little bit of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the pointer behind this technology , which is photosyncratic technology , and this is not so obvious if you look at the environments that we &amp; apos ; ve looked at on the website .
a few years ago , the price of the scientist sheiya yamaca was awarded for his research in which he took a mother &amp; apos ; s home , a fistbute , and through the manipulation of just four genes that produced the industrial cell to return it to a plurchin cell -- a potential cell in any cell in your body .
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in a number of studies , a placebo effect , and that &amp; apos ; s because the person thinks what &amp; apos ; s going to happen to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of a way of doing it -- in pain , for example , if the patient only has enough faith in it , there &amp; apos ; s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
now , let &amp; apos ; s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first most multi ##AT##-##AT## cellular organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that evolved in the last 130,000 years .
it means that a little kid from the andes who &amp; apos ; s growing up in believing that the mountain is an apu ##AT##-##AT## mind , who is an apu ##AT##-##AT## mind , who will determine his destiny , will have a different relationship to this resource or this place , as a small child from montana growing up in the belief that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can carry off .
usually my role is to tell people how wonderful new technologies are going to be , and i thought , because i &amp; apos ; m here with friends , i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you what i really think , and also try to look back and understand what &amp; apos ; s really going on here , with these incredible jumps forward , which are going to happen so fast that we can barely keep up .
so i went home and ate with my wife at night and told her about everything , and we thought , &amp; quot ; well , wait a second , if there &amp; apos ; s this technology that you can use to control things , we should find a way to control a laser , so that he can control a laser , so that he can do graffiti again , but that would be brilliant . &amp; quot ;
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems in something that you &amp; apos ; ve got later on -- and the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world looking at ipcc and saying , okay , that &amp; apos ; s not a big dryama .
and right now in biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.t. code is an abstract code , which is , yes , it &amp; apos ; s not exactly the same as computers , because it &amp; apos ; s dynamic because it &amp; apos ; s matter , so matter is real matter , and not just cycling .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said before she died , that her greatest fear is that , as we move towards a thread , <unk> less , we would not only reduce the entire range of human imagination into a way of thinking , but that one day , we would have forgotten , and forgotten that there had ever been other possibilities .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of southeast , we &amp; apos ; re setting people down -- here &amp; apos ; s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white than when it &amp; apos ; s black , 22 times higher if the advertarians are black and the victim knows -- in the same state of the united states , in which its bodies rest of the world .
i used to travel with a young colleague of mine , 3,000 miles from chengdu jain in west china through southeast tibet to lhasa , and only when i got to lhasa , i saw the face of those statistics that you hear behind , which is 6,000 sacred monuments that were turned into rubble , and 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering for francis arnold and willing , two scientists , who were encouraged by each other to work the natural process of evolution faster and to have desired proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called frarnold &amp; quot ; direct evolution . &amp; quot ;
and they &amp; apos ; ve set up these two hobbyists , and they said , okay , we &amp; apos ; re doing it easier and cheaper , and then out of open source , so we &amp; apos ; ve got free hardware available , electronics , this device , and they &amp; apos ; re now actually now the cheapest supply of these devices around the world .
in the early &amp; apos ; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and filing the secret societies that were the foundation of duvicities and tonton couchton and the poison that was used to make zooms .
&amp; quot ; cloud ##AT##-##AT## computing computing , &amp; quot ; something my friends at autodesk , call &amp; quot ; intolerable computing , &amp; quot ; sensors , &amp; quot ; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow them to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , scientific materials , vaccination , vaccines and digital medicine , digital medicine and artificial intelligence .
at the bottom of the picture , you can see the lab , in leadership , so there &amp; apos ; s one that filled garage with all sorts of very possible lab scaffolding that &amp; apos ; s posted to college , a group in paris that &amp; apos ; s been doing something that &amp; apos ; s pretty successful , and it &amp; apos ; s pretty interesting to do , because i want to cut a project for a second .
and from a conversation this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share it with you -- he gave me permission -- his technology , which is called &amp; quot ; sheikh , &amp; quot ; and many of you may have heard . it &amp; apos ; s the size of a refrigerator in the home .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a molecule has a million times as much energy as one , let &amp; apos ; s say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they &amp; apos ; re mostly the radiation , the footprint , the footprint and the cost , the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a liga .
the result is -- we call it &amp; quot ; patient autonomy , &amp; quot ; which sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift in responsibility for making people &amp; apos ; s responsibility for making decisions about someone who knows something -- nameless -- somebody who doesn &amp; apos ; t know anything , and it &amp; apos ; s probably worse , and therefore not in the best constitution , it &amp; apos ; s a decision -- namely , the patient .
and that would be their answer to the bjorn logical argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals below , the poverty reduction , the reduction of malaria and so on , there &amp; apos ; s a stupid waste of resources to invest in while there are better things we can do .
really , some happy people and companies , forward ##AT##-##AT## based profits , got the unique opportunity -- because i &amp; apos ; m sure chris anderson will never let this happen -- the namental rights to the talk that you &amp; apos ; ll see right now , who didn &amp; apos ; t have a title or a lot of content at that time , and didn &amp; apos ; t give a lot of clues to what the subject would actually be .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time the co2 gets rid of it , the skeptic also says , &amp; quot ; okay , i &amp; apos ; m not interested that it doesn &amp; apos ; t involve carbon , i &amp; apos ; d rather wish it to do it , but i &amp; apos ; m going to accept it because it &amp; apos ; s cheaper than the previous method . &amp; quot ;
this was a simple trick , of course , of dr. papt , so that i did the training i didn &amp; apos ; t want to do with the prospect of being a five ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old girl in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily horrendous horns with new eyes , so it became a new and varied experience .
and to show the dimension , i &amp; apos ; ve been looking at all kinds of batteries that are being made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , cell phones , anything . and i &amp; apos ; ve got that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to , i found that all batteries that we can now store less than 10 minutes of the energy we can now store .
when a no one said that was the oroasis , which was a complete mess , i &amp; apos ; ve been very hard to doubt myself for 10 years , whether i was actually having my great engineering graduate student , because all of my colleagues were always talking to him , you know , you &amp; apos ; ve sent the money out to the window to your child .
we clean the chromosome off a microspecies , so roughly , they &amp; apos ; re both so far away from humans and mice , and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome , and we crushed it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was quite amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &amp; apos ; re going to estimate our very sophisticated chart here .

rg : now we haven &amp; apos ; t set ourselves to a place , and there &amp; apos ; s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything called &amp; quot ; <unk> ar . &amp; quot ; there &amp; apos ; s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india -- i was here and i met the minister of energy , and i talked about how this fits to energy agenda .
the human ability to adapt -- that &amp; apos ; s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me how to deal with witches , and i &amp; apos ; m going to give you something : that sentence never fit for me , and i &amp; apos ; ve always felt very uncomfortable about trying to answer people &amp; apos ; s questions , and i think i &amp; apos ; m starting to understand why .
i had this encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth ruth stone who &amp; apos ; s now over 90 , but her whole life was poet , and she told me that when she was growing up in the fields of virginia , she was working on the fields , she said she &amp; apos ; d feel and hear a poem about the landscape .
now , i &amp; apos ; d like to start with an example of someone who had a fraser and answer after one of my lectures that had a story . &amp; # 91 ; unclear &amp; # 93 ; he said he &amp; apos ; d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music , and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible chalk .

these people have come online to wealth , but they &amp; apos ; ve banned it by using trojansers to make money from our bank accounts while we &amp; apos ; re doing our online banking , or keyboards that are collecting our credit cards in the gift of the keyboard , while we &amp; apos ; re buying over a computer infected online .
bruce brown , a well ##AT##-##AT## known design researcher at the britton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , not the internet , etc . , and so on , what we call mass media today , that this mass media of our memories and our ability to replicate .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of a writing process , prairie , love , love . i fell into one of those buried in doubt that we all fall into when we &amp; apos ; re working on something and it doesn &amp; apos ; t work . you &amp; apos ; ll find that it &amp; apos ; s a disaster . it &amp; apos ; s the worst book ever written .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral notre lady , who was only on the computer with images of flickr . just give nore queen in flickr , and they &amp; apos ; re getting images of men in t ##AT##-##AT## shirts , and they &amp; apos ; re being found on the university site , and so on . each one of these orange slugs represents a picture that was found as a model of hearing .
that made me a different person than my friends under the kwakil routine , who believe that these forests are the last place of huykuk and the curved celestial objects that are in the northern world that they would participate in their hamburgers .
i recommend reading all of you , or looking at the movie , so that you don &amp; apos ; t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came from these two men , but also how the music helped create this connection , and how it was ultimately the instrument when this word game allows you to get away from the street .
and so i ended up getting interested in the people who are interested in space and who are dealing with nasa and who are in nasa &amp; apos ; s nasa &amp; apos ; s nasa expertise , and they &amp; apos ; re doing right space exploration , and they &amp; apos ; re going to go to russia , and they &amp; apos ; re going through the biomedical protocol , and they &amp; apos ; re going to fly around the international space station , and we &amp; apos ; re taking our 3d camera systems .
and that &amp; apos ; s really , really , really , really bidding , and you &amp; apos ; re going to go into such a ne phase , and that &amp; apos ; s where i just came across a picture where i asked myself , after 10 years , a thousand mark mark mark , that &amp; apos ; s where , of course , was the great thing to do .
we also have one of these trans ##AT##-##AT## aggression in the same size as it stands there , into the hall , to actually take the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the middle of the network it looks like this , there &amp; apos ; s the one in the back here , there &amp; apos ; s the big battery here , and here &amp; apos ; s the whole judge that we &amp; apos ; re doing with the web .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret to the best friend &amp; apos ; s prize , even though that one &amp; apos ; s been kind of a disconcerting and then you get caught up , and the best friend gets a terrible argument at the end , but at the end of the day , you get the bad fortune , and you &amp; apos ; ll never make a mistake like that .
so what we did in a study that i did with shlomo benzi and alessandro pro previo , we did a study with people at mit -- employees who &amp; apos ; d all worked for flying -- and these people were all in a meeting where they signed up for their retirement savings plan .
you know , one of the great connotations of travel , and one of the joys in ethnicity is to live with the people who still remember the old days , and they still feel their past in the wind , they &amp; apos ; re touching cold rocks , they &amp; apos ; re touching the sleeves of the plants .
i was scared , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could fall in one of his conditions , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin , if i started talking about tonnas and pedroughts and other exciting forms of the <unk> dagogy .
i then tried this in my lab at home , and then i bought myself a little bit of setup setup on ebay , and i did a little bit of d.j. analysis , trying to do a dad &amp; apos ; s , which is , like , &amp; quot ; nfa fingerprint , &amp; quot ; again , to get home again .
and so o with this premise that , for example , brian degger then tried to put together a miniature <unk> ator in england , and then this is a steam pipe , a heat plate , and , you know , subunk , and it &amp; apos ; s burnt bacteria .
and then , in part , if you look at the software that we &amp; apos ; ve just seen , then you &amp; apos ; ll also understand why ninety ##AT##-##AT## nine percent of our today &amp; apos ; s software is little intuitively intuitive , or not based on antich , which i &amp; apos ; m going to put in a lot of areas or so on , although it &amp; apos ; s already much more intuitive than classic .
the computer visionary algorithms have captured these images together so that they &amp; apos ; ve captured the real space where all of these images that are made near the gravei of canada are related to the canadian rockies , and you can see here elements of stabilized , or panama imaging , and these things are all sort of embedded in relation to each other .
interestingly , what &amp; apos ; s interesting is , when the mollen southern spain conquered this practice , and the search changed over the centuries of <unk> allah , allah , allah , zol√© , ol√© , which you &amp; apos ; re still fighting and listening to .
if i was in a room full of colleagues asking for their immediate support and telling them what i just told you about , i would probably not reach the end of the second story before they were really uncomfortable , anybody would confuse a joke , they would change the subject and forget the rest .
and that &amp; apos ; s when you take all your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we &amp; apos ; re really excited about , is government , in the words of tim &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; rusty , &amp; quot ; which together we can &amp; apos ; t do that alone .

now today , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this one -- something that &amp; apos ; s been able to monitor the car in real time , a few thousand sensors that have information from the car , pass that information on to the system , and then use it to send that car back and change things in real time .
if i want to leave you with one thing today , that the total of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of its individual parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information so that patterns and we can see trends that would never have been visible .
there &amp; apos ; s 175 dressings in my grocery store , if you don &amp; apos ; t take the 10 different extra olive oil companies and 12 balitters that you could buy to make a huge number of your own salads , in which unlikely case not to be the 175 in the store for you .
no biologist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &amp; apos ; s just not true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarios around the field of biological diversity -- hardly the one that &amp; apos ; s known to us as the most optimistic scenarios of the cultural diversity .
the first time you become a child , as a baby , is that you care about what kind of divorce you &amp; apos ; ve got , right ? and the first time your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the pot and drill down , the more you know , your curiosity will be encrypted .
i had written this piece &amp; quot ; avatar , &amp; quot ; which was supposed to be the bar in things like visual effects and computer ##AT##-##AT## generated effects in all new heights , with realistic human characters that had been made using cg , and the main characters should all be cg . and the world should be cg .
you know ? i think it &amp; apos ; s a mere person to allow him to think that he thinks he thinks he &amp; apos ; s or she &amp; apos ; s like the vessel , like the basin , and the essence , and the source of all the divine , creative , infinite mysteries , is a little bit too small for them to distill a fraser , human psyche .
so by changing color , contrast and helplessness at the edges of the individual images , photographic images such as field capture , despiration and disorders , we &amp; apos ; re wiping the borders between the different images and letting them look like a single photograph , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
this set of knowledge from dealing with the idea that success or happiness depends on how to master a challenge without being associated with it , as if my life had been so successful , because i could avoid the potential of life with a prosthetic arm , or whatever humans could perceive me with my disability .
as i &amp; apos ; ve been looking for models over the last year to do this , i &amp; apos ; ve also been looking for this in the past , and i &amp; apos ; ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more reasonable ideas about it than we can help to deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
it &amp; apos ; s actually dairy that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , had two mirrors in two different surgeons , and decides which one to choose , then the one who has the memory that &amp; apos ; s less bad , and that &amp; apos ; s the surgeon who &amp; apos ; s chosen .
so , the fact is that you will remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its wars or technological innovations , but rather as an era where we &amp; apos ; ve been against and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active or passively accepted . so , the problem is not change .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it &amp; apos ; s more than $ 80,000 genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cassette tape size of the virus , which was the size of the tape we &amp; apos ; ve been able to vary to understand what the components of a living cell is .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature that was believed to be that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &amp; apos ; s studio -- sort of like dusby , the 11 -- who came out and created the artist at work in a certain sort of unison , and would make the result of the work .
you know , when michelangelo formed the moses , it means at the end of him he took the hammer and threw him on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little bit of a scourge under -- and said , &amp; quot ; per√© pardon pardon pardon ? why don &amp; apos ; t you talk ? &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; ve probably heard , the two nice girls are still there , i &amp; apos ; m probably the generation that &amp; apos ; s been hearing about this bad oko image , because i &amp; apos ; ve already started studying ninety ##AT##-##AT## nine hundred yards of machinery in cartilage , engineering college , i think it &amp; apos ; s called kipling .
and i know some of you say , &amp; quot ; isn &amp; apos ; t it any better ? &amp; quot ; so , wouldn &amp; apos ; t the world be a better place if we &amp; apos ; d all talk a language ? &amp; quot ; and i say , &amp; quot ; well , let &amp; apos ; s be this language of yor<unk> ba . let &amp; apos ; s be katie .
it would be great if we could introduce this paradigm of normality to another possibility or strength to actually change it a little bit more vulnerable , so we can free the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very specific and valuable skills to society .
if i show you 600 magazines and i split them in 10 categories , or i &amp; apos ; m showing you 400 magazines , and i &amp; apos ; m showing you those in 20 categories , you &amp; apos ; ll think i &amp; apos ; ve given you more choice and a better way of giving them a better escape than i &amp; apos ; ve given you the 400 of them if i gave them the 600 .
he spoke in a very senior and gregyton about yoyo and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never be able to create it in the baseball world , and it &amp; apos ; s all because of the crappy passage of the first violin in beethoven &amp; apos ; s last sentence .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©sum√© i &amp; apos ; ve ever experienced , because before i went around a corner , i always knew what was going to happen in the light of the vehicle because i was running over film scenes for months when we turned the movie .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , as our fellow scott silkman silveres as part of the program -- in fact , they &amp; apos ; re all doing this -- you &amp; apos ; ll see that the people who call government for many different problems , including a marsupial rat in your house .
we &amp; apos ; re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think that we &amp; apos ; d have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time when we &amp; apos ; ve been fighting progress , where we &amp; apos ; ve had these things that have heavy impact on them .
what i &amp; apos ; m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &amp; apos ; ve been giving microsoft as part of a overload just a year ago , which is seams , and it &amp; apos ; s an environment where you can either go from local or vast amounts of visual data .
this equation has four factors . it &amp; apos ; s a little bit multiplicity . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to move towards zero , and that &amp; apos ; s going to depend on the number of people that you use on the average , the average energy consumption of every service and the co2 that &amp; apos ; s being delivered on energy .
in my 20s of medicine and journalism , i &amp; apos ; ve created a personal medical study about medical mistakes and wrong treatments to make everything possible for me to learn from my first article in toronto that i &amp; apos ; ve written for my &amp; quot ; white cote , black art , &amp; quot ; which is to learn .
so we have a situation where , as we continue our science continues , we need to be so much more aware that these categories that we &amp; apos ; d thought were a stable anatomic categories that made very simple to create lasting identity categories are much lower than we &amp; apos ; ve assumed .
and what we &amp; apos ; ve done is we &amp; apos ; ve actually used a new kind of network that &amp; apos ; s been used all over the world -- that &amp; apos ; s a mobile phone network -- and it &amp; apos ; s anonymous , and it &amp; apos ; s taking information from this network that &amp; apos ; s collected from the operator to understand how the city works .
and if you were to choose another vacation , there &amp; apos ; s a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &amp; apos ; s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you &amp; apos ; d get an answer . and if you think in the sense of memories , you might get a different answer .
and then it just came from the do ##AT##-##AT## it ##AT##-##AT## yourself bief ##AT##-##AT## then website of founder , and i said , &amp; quot ; okay , we &amp; apos ; ve got to meet now , we &amp; apos ; re going to meet real , we &amp; apos ; re going to have two events in london , one in two thousand , 10 , and just in the u.s. , san francisco . &amp; quot ;
my colleague , at mit , asaf bider , could give you a lot more insight about the senses , and the many other wonderful things you can do with vision , but i &amp; apos ; d like to talk to you about the second part that we discussed in the beginning , and that &amp; apos ; s our environment .
a group from ankara , who i met a while ago , who &amp; apos ; s a student of mine who liked to convey more of what they learn in college , and they &amp; apos ; ve done so on the street small actions , and they &amp; apos ; re trying to explain what d.c is .
i think a significant -- not the only thing , but a significant cantor of this explosion in depression , and also suicide , people have learned that their standards are so high because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain that experience , they think it would be their fault .
the people in the back or the ones who will see that later on will say , &amp; quot ; well , that looks pretty impressive , but if it were real , it would be -- you see , here &amp; apos ; s a hole and there , if it were real , it would be bloody . &amp; quot ;
but it &amp; apos ; s found that 17 brand partners who were willing to give up on this control of someone who wanted to do business as remarkable and as i did , who eventually managed to tell us stories that we couldn &amp; apos ; t tell -- stories that would never help a bribe .
but because there was only one company willing to help us -- and that &amp; apos ; s just because i know john bond and richard church trees for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle man and go straight to my team .
i mean , most of the moments of life -- and i &amp; apos ; ve calculated this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . what it means is , you know , there &amp; apos ; s about 600 million of them in a month . there &amp; apos ; s about 600,000 left . most of them don &amp; apos ; t leave any trace .
but we don &amp; apos ; t even tend to even listen to someone like this because we &amp; apos ; ve known this kind of talk about it for so long , and somehow we &amp; apos ; ve sort of embraced the notion of inner light and collective that creativity and suffering are , of course , related to art at the end -- always leads to souls .
but in fact , we see there &amp; apos ; s more and more , that if you &amp; apos ; re willing to narrow down , and the unimportant things are going on , well , there &amp; apos ; s an increase in sales , there &amp; apos ; s an increase in sales , there &amp; apos ; s r &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; d , and there &amp; apos ; s an improvement in decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
i had to repeat individual exercises many times with these dials , elastic bounds -- in different colors -- you know , you know , i hated my leg muscles , and i hated those tape more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
well , not exactly what i hoped , but i went down -- the stairs up , the stairs , the curse , past the real firemen , who were already quite finished at that point in the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i &amp; apos ; ve been interested in the placebo effect for a while . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because , you know , you look at it the way i think , &amp; quot ; a deception that &amp; apos ; s going to become a real delusion , if only somebody &amp; apos ; s committed enough to believe it . &amp; quot ;
and where you can see how far we &amp; apos ; re away from that , what we really wanted and could be , and how sad we are , that we &amp; apos ; re at all on earth , can you see that , for example , open bach has a program , up to 20 to 40 years , you want to be cliche here , right ?
and they &amp; apos ; re going to get healthier , and they &amp; apos ; re going to be trained better through the thopedic academy , and by doing so , they &amp; apos ; re going to have the ability to use 3d printers and incinerating computing , and so much more productive than they &amp; apos ; ve ever been before .
well , i like to be a little bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite i have on the celebration of memories , but even if you make more of them , there &amp; apos ; s a real question . why do we give memories of weight to the weight that we experience ?
because we &amp; apos ; re having this sense of being great , stem from the highest creature , not from such a nature of such a nature , of something as an organism that &amp; apos ; s still existing , like an organism that &amp; apos ; s still around us , to a rock and what other things like that , it &amp; apos ; s inundable to us .
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo acrylic in a translucent state , burning coal without burning , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to affect the body in such that it stops when it &amp; apos ; s pushed into a state of extreme arousal .
deratbute &amp; apos ; s things are things that are played fresh like the freder ##AT##-##AT## prince , contemporary , adventurous , sweet , sweet and sweet , like erborska , agile and agile , protagonist , alerous and mystic and mystic .
and the realization of president lobo was that the confidence of the occupation of the occupation that i &amp; apos ; ve been thinking about as a way to get foreign investors to come and build this city as significant as all parties in honduras for many years and abuse .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of the life of an unknown incident -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who were running every single day for 20 years by telling each other the stories of their day and sleeping , we &amp; apos ; re still three in the same bed .
it really works , it &amp; apos ; s done in academic dating , and then we thought , okay , we &amp; apos ; ll get that , then we &amp; apos ; ve taken a webcam , and then we &amp; apos ; ve taken a webcam , and we &amp; apos ; ve turned the lens off , and then you &amp; apos ; ve got a microscope that &amp; apos ; s about four hundred times bigger .
in this picture , i &amp; apos ; ve set up a bush as a center of branching into all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the species that have had on the tips of these two have had an evolutionary success : they survived ; it &amp; apos ; s survived ; it &amp; apos ; s got its limits and strength .
i read this list by a friend of mine , and i had to laugh at once , it was so ridiculous , but i just got up to &amp; quot ; focused , &amp; quot ; and i couldn &amp; apos ; t stop talking , and i had to stop reading , and i started to collect myself after that transition tide , and it connected to the emotional shock .
now this may seem a little bit remote , so i repeat this : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
we don &amp; apos ; t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually attracted to other men who are punished with death , because he &amp; apos ; s willing to move to a gender condition , in which case he can stay alive .
so what &amp; apos ; s happening in &amp; quot ; the great forest moore &amp; apos ; s solo &amp; quot ; is that everything , from the top to the bottom , from the end to the bottom , is completely tagged with brands -- from the cover of the movie you &amp; apos ; ll see in the movie , that &amp; apos ; s the x .
the greatest car that you &amp; apos ; ve ever driven out of &amp; quot ; the great forest forest forest earth &amp; quot ; is &amp; quot ; the greatest drink that you &amp; apos ; ve ever had , a sense of &amp; quot ; the grey forest . &amp; quot ;
and there was a time when there was only jeans in one way , and they bought it , and they were bad at it , they were incredibly incompatible , and if they had been able to wash it for a long time and many times enough , they were starting to feel &amp; quot ; ok . &amp; quot ;
and maybe a little bit of a look at what might have happened in a few decades , if you have cycling bodies to explore or do other things , in all sorts of post ##AT##-##AT## human futures that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , tg.gussky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , wrote a phrase that said , &amp; quot ; nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of evolution . &amp; quot ;
neolymous revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment , the cuban missile took us from the seeds of the seeds , the poetry of the shaman &amp; apos ; s remark and hierarchy of priesthood and specialization -- only 10,000 years ago .
and the problem , it &amp; apos ; s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a problem , it can be a problem problem problem , it can be a problem problem problem , which is , you know , a problem solving any problem , and how you can do it differently .
and then there &amp; apos ; s a remembered self , and the memory itself , which is the sharing and the story of our life , and it &amp; apos ; s dairy , and the doctor speaks to the question , he says , &amp; quot ; how did you feel in the last time ? &amp; quot ;
and one day , he looked at me at one of my exercises -- these practices were just tiring and glitless -- and he said to me , &amp; quot ; wow , aimee , you &amp; apos ; re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &amp; apos ; re going to tear up one day of these tape .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> at , pray , love -- which , unlike all my previous books , decided to go out into the world for some reason and become a major mega ##AT##-##AT## mega ##AT##-##AT## event , international performance thing .
but the process and the heavy comfort he surrounds him was when he took the genius out of it , where he got out of trouble , and he left him back where he came from , and he realized that it had not to be an internal , agonizing thing .
in our wish , to protect the people who are at heart and to tell you the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a prediction for the quality of life that they &amp; apos ; re expected to do , we &amp; apos ; ve got to pay attention that we don &amp; apos ; t actually put the basic stone to the fact that somebody &amp; apos ; s actually disabled .
what &amp; apos ; s really nice about it is , if you do that , agriculture is producing biogas on a hectare of five thousand people in favelas , a farmer can grow about a thousand dollars , and they &amp; apos ; ll wait for that to grow chickens and vegetables and vegetables .
every time we think of it as an unborn and landscape , we &amp; apos ; re either admiral , and the old rumor of the wild wild wild wild wild , which in its simplification is a sort of racism , or on the other hand , and these people are more connected to nature than we are .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists that we &amp; apos ; ve done , we just need a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &amp; apos ; s reasonable , you &amp; apos ; re just in the 1000,000 ##AT##-##AT## million .
imagination is more implantable on knockerland , and with that sentence , i &amp; apos ; d like to end a , a and give the hint , also designers to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
that &amp; apos ; s a little bit more artistic direction , so there &amp; apos ; s a lot of artists and philosophers , and they &amp; apos ; re working with scientists , and they &amp; apos ; re trying to engage with these technologies , and they &amp; apos ; re asking questions that are creative , because there &amp; apos ; s museum exhibitions and yes , they &amp; apos ; re all kinds of things .
so the tedtalk presented in a very simple form that a charter city is a place whose early housing country is a greener contract , a greener contract , that defines the laws that exist there , and gives people an opportunity to choose either under those rules or not .
later on day later , i was driving around this site with miguel , and i asked him , &amp; quot ; for a place that seems to be so natural , &amp; quot ; unlike any farm i &amp; apos ; ve ever been on , &amp; quot ; how do you measure success ? &amp; quot ;

the reason for that is , if i were to draw it on a normal curve , where , let &amp; apos ; s say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is an arbitrary piece of technology that i &amp; apos ; d like to present with a graph , that &amp; apos ; s the graph .

so where the founding fathers were extremely careful to figure out how individuals could be protected from the state , it &amp; apos ; s possible that if we gave more mothers to this concept , we were more of a concept , not just how to protect each other , but how to care for each other .
a continent is always being balanced , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub ##AT##-##AT## saharan africa , and of course there was a and voodoo just the remains of this very profound religious thought that came along during the tragic diaspora of time .

many companies tend to -- and that &amp; apos ; s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &amp; apos ; re not sure , they &amp; apos ; re going to be afraid , they &amp; apos ; re going to avoid these elements , and they &amp; apos ; re going to welcome these elements , and they &amp; apos ; re actually turning them into something positive for themselves , and that &amp; apos ; s a fine chess game .
with total transparency , which is what the new thinking is , what banging on the old thinking , don &amp; apos ; t tell you that in the layered meat of horse meat and beef is no longer beef anymore or other phenomena , which is , i want to do it right now , and that &amp; apos ; s what i want to do .
he went up at high speed when he suddenly heard a little questionnaire of a melody that is often very difficult for him to do it for him , and he wants to have it . he &amp; apos ; s a prairie . he goes off , but he can &amp; apos ; t touch it .
and if i go back and look at everything , i can rearrange my search for my search past , here i am looking for &amp; apos ; newest , here &amp; apos ; s where i &amp; apos ; m looking , here &amp; apos ; s where i &amp; apos ; m going , here &amp; apos ; s the mash mash .
here it looks like he &amp; apos ; s looking for a date , but what he really looks for is somebody who &amp; apos ; s free when he &amp; apos ; s asleep , because he knows he &amp; apos ; s not very good at preventing him when he &amp; apos ; s covered by a meter of snow .
these older people are coming up to me now and they say , &amp; quot ; mir , stendson , you &amp; apos ; re talking , you &amp; apos ; re talking . they &amp; apos ; re telling people that you should stop saying we &amp; apos ; ve got to do it for the first time in our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &amp; quot ;
this is , if you focus a laser , in a room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so it &amp; apos ; s trapped , like a trainer , basically .
here &amp; apos ; s another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call from a young man who was born when he was a boy , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found that he had eternity and a mother .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people that i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &amp; apos ; t , all the fences that i wanted to kick out , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never did .
but if we look at this metallic map that &amp; apos ; s very simple in comparison with ours . trust me , that &amp; apos ; s easy . but if we look at all of those genes that we can eliminate after another one , it &amp; apos ; s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
there &amp; apos ; s some pilot projects that can do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &amp; apos ; s very difficult to get 100 percent of them , and to get some sort of a deal with the amount of co2 , which is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the storage question .
so i &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about a study that i did with gur hubereberman , eamca , whose goal was to save the lives of almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &amp; apos ; t line up between male and female , or male and internal and internal , we are , of course , the line is natural .
the leaders of honor government in honduras would depend on the aid of partner countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that would help them with the laws of these charter for this charter and through the leadership that everybody can trust that the charter is really being applied .
and then the next one , which has already come in with &amp; quot ; nimble neural model , &amp; quot ; or mental model like the software of egongongonal , &amp; quot ; which is , you know , you &amp; apos ; ve got an idea of something that &amp; apos ; s the metaphor of a desktop , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer more reliable .
they knew that about 75,000 honduras left their country to go out into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that &amp; apos ; s recently come out of the market about how to manage the best choice of choice , was something that david <unk> an has been very much about , it &amp; apos ; s a program that &amp; apos ; s offered at harvard .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the malaysia coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first one who gave me one of the men on the platform .
we followed the geneticiology of eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about it , they reported that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with the spears .
and now you could talk about why that &amp; apos ; s a deception , why you don &amp; apos ; t realize that there &amp; apos ; s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &amp; apos ; t count , one , two , three , but it &amp; apos ; s seen as a group .
and in front of the background , i went to the realm of nature &amp; apos ; s natural interface design , so the next generation of human computers in which computers relate to how our tools are changing , or how the computer changes from the computer &amp; apos ; s machine to the digital assistant .
they then gave me a three ##AT##-##AT## month time time period with a &amp; quot ; enough &amp; quot ; note , &amp; quot ; which was very good , &amp; quot ; and they were told they were very smart . and after these three months , they actually signed up .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 to ninety percent renewable , and then there &amp; apos ; s this other one , the last 10 , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that &amp; apos ; s going to be very , very expensive , and it won &amp; apos ; t work too much for you to do that out of batteries .
the main reason for this is that we may be enjoying this huge shelves of maya , mustard , eg , etc . , but we can &amp; apos ; t actually look at the comparison and periodically , and then actually choose something of the amazing offer .
here you have this alarm clock between the unconscious and the conscious one who jumps right away without something you can do about it , and the things that you know that you look very different is designed to sound a lot better for you and others .
i took them down to the bottom of the world : astrobiologists , planetary biologists , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to look at them , take samples and test instruments and so on .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation are born , they look at them as the oramidst and colorful , but they sort of narrow down to the past as the real world goes on in our world .
by playing music and talking about music , there was this paranoid , confusing man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a lovely , well ##AT##-##AT## trained , trained , world ##AT##-##AT## class musician in juilliard .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking about thinking is , we think at a certain abstract level , this machine , and the machine will give you something that goes way beyond our ability to do better than we could ever do it .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of modern artist artist who tried to master these uncontrolled creative impulses that he lived in , and come with them .
but if you buy a new color laser printer in 2011 from the top laser scanning parts of the world , print out a page , then this page has printed the bright yellow blob on each side , in a pattern that clearly covers the page and gives back its printer back .
feeding crops on plant heretics , pest resources for monopoly on monopoly , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all of a sudden the agricultural industry just asked , &amp; quot ; if we feed more people more cheaply , how awful can that be ? &amp; quot ;
in some of the following expeditions , i &amp; apos ; ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &amp; apos ; ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one &amp; apos ; s ever seen before , and for the science at the time when we saw them , there were no words at all .
so not just a farm that &amp; apos ; s not feeding their animals , not just a farm that &amp; apos ; s measuring their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that &amp; apos ; s literally a waterfront facility , and not just these fish , but also for you and me .
in fact , i &amp; apos ; ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career to horrible situations , and it &amp; apos ; s all for trying to study social rambling like that , and it &amp; apos ; s interesting , and hopefully it &amp; apos ; s accessible in a way that makes them accessible and accessible to the audience .
and then the renaissance came along , and it all changed , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &amp; apos ; s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there &amp; apos ; s no room for mystic creatures taking orders from divinity .
they &amp; apos ; re expanding the amount of co2 that goes up to temperature , and that increasing temperature has some very negative implications , and effects on the weather , and maybe worse , and perhaps worse , that the natural ecosystems can &amp; apos ; t adapt so rapidly to change , and so the whole systems collapse together .
but in fact , you &amp; apos ; d have thought about it for a long time , but you could never simulate it , whether it would work , but ever since there &amp; apos ; s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right materialist approach , it looks like it works .
in other paintings , she wasn &amp; apos ; t fast enough . she ran up and ran , but she didn &amp; apos ; t reach the house , and she wouldn &amp; apos ; t hit the house , and she would fit through it , and she would say , she would continue to move across the country , and she would say -- and she &amp; apos ; d look for another poet .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species of extinction plants find these two morphologically non ##AT##-##AT## related plants , which , when combined with this , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole larger than the sum of its parts ?
tan le , anonymous living in food crash , was now tan , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak at places that had never heard of , and in housing , whose existence they never could have imagined .
and dr. kean kept telling himself , he said , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; ve learned that if you don &amp; apos ; t get anything else , if you don &amp; apos ; t always get a little bit of support , if you give kids a lot of support , then kids can do a lot . &amp; quot ;
how many times did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we recline back , and we expect the government to reflect our values and our needs , and then didn &amp; apos ; t change much ?
well , what you could do with the patient , and we actually did clinical trial experiments , and it &amp; apos ; s been done , and it works , and you could actually extend the reflection of the patient by just letting the tube in there without even tearing it too much .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , which you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and which you could fly after all , after all , around your ears , especially if i had your company for your participation .
about a half an hour after she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed home , and the family called 9 / 11 , they brought back to the emergency room with a blood pressure station of 50 , which is a dangerous condition .
understand that it &amp; apos ; s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to jail because they don &amp; apos ; t have enough money to go back , it means making decisions that make them so difficult that they miss big investment in their employers .
that &amp; apos ; s when patients come to play . they can &amp; apos ; t just take control of the control , the captain on their own ship , but they can also help us with health care in the face of the challenges that we face , and the cost of health care , twice demand , and so on .
the next couple of weeks , i proposed , and i first learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of dying of healthy shame that you feel , because you can &amp; apos ; t talk to the colleagues .
this curiosity also showed that i was always in school when i wasn &amp; apos ; t in school , traveling through the forests , collecting samples , frogs and snakes and fishermen and pond , and they brought everything back home and looked under the microscope .
so i also wrote an article about it , and i couldn &amp; apos ; t understand why people thought that this was &amp; quot ; franken ##AT##-##AT## food , &amp; quot ; why they thought that molecules were a kind of random force in nature , rather than a random sort of push around the area of nature .
these may be a modern contribution , and if they do better than i expect , that would be great , but my point here is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &amp; apos ; t give up any of them because they &amp; apos ; re shy , because they all have significant problems .
and as you can see , you &amp; apos ; ve got our seven senses , most people think we &amp; apos ; ve only got five , and now we &amp; apos ; ve even known seven , and there &amp; apos ; s certainly seven of them in the near future , there &amp; apos ; s certainly a lot of meaning in the future , and there &amp; apos ; s an extension of our own self .
since then , i &amp; apos ; ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with cos from the continuing 50 company , and there &amp; apos ; s something about this task that allows deep footprints to work together , and i want to share some of them with you .
so , if you look at google glass , for example , that &amp; apos ; s a concept that allows us to recombine the virtual world with the real world , which is our affection for virtualization , which is to feel the virtual thing that &amp; apos ; s normal , natural .
and then , if i go one more step further into this natural user interface , where i &amp; apos ; m using voice , by using language , by hand , by gesture , by gesture , and not by mouse and cursor , i &amp; apos ; m even faster , and i &amp; apos ; m more immediate .
now , what this thing does is it infects the sensors of sensors -- so for example , using pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legislative code that &amp; apos ; s going on during the attack , with the wrong data .
i &amp; apos ; m more likely to be able to make sure that we don &amp; apos ; t necessarily have to overcome wits , but that we &amp; apos ; re open to embrace it , to put it on the band ##AT##-##AT## aid to use it , and maybe even to dance with it .
we think pos -- we think poleomics is not persuasive , but we believe storytelling can change the world , and so we &amp; apos ; re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hides every month .
but what &amp; apos ; s happening , almost always , is that the &amp; quot ; tada &amp; quot ; becomes a &amp; quot ; uh ##AT##-##AT## oh , &amp; quot ; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to turn out and fall down .
so , what that means is , if we look back at what &amp; apos ; s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and particularly how we look forward to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
you &amp; apos ; re doing it for the sake of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is there . you &amp; apos ; re doing it for exploration , and for the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people is formed .
i &amp; apos ; ve talked to you about four techniques that are addressing the problem of decision ##AT##-##AT## making -- they will limit the excess alternatives ; concrete -- they &amp; apos ; ll make it real ; they &amp; apos ; ll categorize it ; -- we &amp; apos ; ll be able to deal with more categories , less possibilities ; we &amp; apos ; ll prepare for complexity .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i &amp; apos ; ve ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how i think of other people .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , the thermostat are , and by doing so , the hot vapor will survive otherwise if fish were there , there would be a vacuum of eggs to follow , yet they managed to make a habitable environment for themselves .
i think they &amp; apos ; ve been so brave and strong , and so radical , in which they &amp; apos ; ve made me look at the sheer number of years of music in 1776 , and it &amp; apos ; s not because of the music that &amp; apos ; s absolutely forgotten .
i don &amp; apos ; t know if that &amp; apos ; s smart , if you take the importance of this problem in front of your eyes , but there &amp; apos ; s a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things get faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how it all started with rna , but i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you a little bit of a simplistic history of it , which is that at that time , there were little oil droplets floating around , which held different types of prescription for chemicals .
because i don &amp; apos ; t care if it &amp; apos ; s the minister of health that says , &amp; quot ; hmm , i &amp; apos ; m not going to accept the evidence of my expert on mammography , &amp; quot ; or some cancerous tobber who wants to treat his patients with coffee .
and if you &amp; apos ; ve done that for a couple of minutes , you &amp; apos ; ve made a decision that the patient &amp; apos ; s life itself is worse off , and you &amp; apos ; ve made the memory of a patient is much better off , because now you &amp; apos ; ve given patients a better story about their experience .
hini , because you assume that he &amp; apos ; s a male -- although i didn &amp; apos ; t tell you that he &amp; apos ; s with xy -- because you assume that he &amp; apos ; s a male , he can now be pulled into what maria doesn &amp; apos ; t have to worry about .
the first project that we &amp; apos ; ve done as an international group , when we &amp; apos ; ve sort of become aware of ourselves , ok , we &amp; apos ; re here now as a real scene , and we &amp; apos ; re online , and we know the people who always chatted and so on .
in other services , like making thin resources , 105 : 05 thousand -- &amp; quot ; 00 pm : 05 : 05,000 , or air traffic , or air traffic traffic , the play room is much smaller .
the idea , again , is to imagine this , again , that we &amp; apos ; re bringing people back to doing something , and to change the environment -- almost like we call it , you know , building skyscraper , but with a cloud .
so , this whole discussion , as it &amp; apos ; s going to go back and forth right now , is energy turning like this , for example , in the island , for example , we have five to 30 percent accuracy of extrusive energy , so we can avoid the wind and the sun .
and i would say , &amp; quot ; and then i &amp; apos ; d hold it up to six and then we &amp; apos ; d go along with friends , and i &amp; apos ; d become the founder of the company , which then became a spin ##AT##-##AT## off company in the world .
it &amp; apos ; s not by the latest joys -- and tracker invention , but by the fruit land , not by pumps , but by pumping fresh water , not by ketchlings , but by forest boats , and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
and in this song , we &amp; apos ; ll be able to rediscover the possibility of being what we are : people with awareness that are important to all the people and gardens to flourish a space that needs to be safe , and there are great moments of optimism .
after all , a consequence of buying a bad seat jeans if there &amp; apos ; s only one way to buy it , that if you &amp; apos ; re uncontent , and you wonder why , who &amp; apos ; s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
you can imagine this cultural web as a ethnicity . ethnicity can be defined as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspections , inspiration and intuitive , that have been created by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
i also want to point out that i &amp; apos ; m not sure that we should be sending rights to people so much , because i have to admit that i have to say that i have a series of golfing drive that is probably more likely to make social security than some people that i know .
i &amp; apos ; ve always prepared my synonymous dictionary , but i &amp; apos ; ve done it with the process of text , and i noticed that i &amp; apos ; ve never looked into my life , which means the word &amp; quot ; disabled . &amp; quot ;
she ran like the devil running the house as she was followed by this poem , and the only thing she did was she had to get fast enough paper and a pen to get a pen so she could catch it if she could go through it and grab it on the sheet .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is half the energy price of co2 without co2 , and i &amp; apos ; ll take this wish .
he said to me , &amp; quot ; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as moving as other kids , or that you could never live an independent life , and since then you just lie down to me . &amp; quot ;
what kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have the ability to repair multi ##AT##-##AT## fold prototype prototypes .
and yeah , so , you see , it &amp; apos ; s relatively heterogeneous , so there &amp; apos ; s a number of people who are doing this on their own , all the way to large , larger organizations that keep doing this already in institutional terms .
so maybe it &amp; apos ; s clear that this technological change is clear , because the fact that there has always been another truth , which is that every human society of society can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human capacity to adapt is our biggest plus .
we look in this web , we see the 50 hertz , and if it &amp; apos ; s nine and a half years old , nine hertz , we &amp; apos ; re going to start doing some valves , and then we &amp; apos ; re going back up a little bit of a mercury steam , and we &amp; apos ; re coming up again .
so we started with a few volunteers who helped us a little over a year ago in seattle to tag the things that they threw away -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that they would throw away .
what if you could change the sperm and the eggs or the fresh fertilization of your children to give them a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes that would reduce the risk of prostate cancer ?
this was the problem : transparency , free of deception and sweat , just to explore and to look through ; to understand ; to understand , character of visibility and access to information , especially in terms of business spray -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
for example , there &amp; apos ; s an anecdote that the report of a capital soundscape that can &amp; apos ; t be used in this area , can &amp; apos ; t be used , or can &amp; apos ; t usually be used by fishing scientists , because it &amp; apos ; s not scientific .
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and then he looked at me , and he said , &amp; quot ; i got here to tell this young man , don &amp; apos ; t lose the destination . don &amp; apos ; t give up . &amp; quot ;
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design them to take a year out and work in an environment that &amp; apos ; s pretty much all they hate , we &amp; apos ; ve let them work in government .
and those sounds and those rhythm have shown the topology of a region , and it &amp; apos ; s also enabled , of course , to bring these songs together and put them together , and to the left , to the right , to move back to the output place .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , this day , when you drive the roof down , you get images of people that were there and say , &amp; quot ; you &amp; apos ; ve destroyed the building . &amp; quot ;
i graduated from mit , and i hope the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bachelk work from michael burk , anghoryin , jorik and jansky .
and as with a miracle , he took his violin , and he began to play for hearing some snippets of violiners , and then i asked myself to end them : menop<unk> , chechvski , sivousa .
so she &amp; apos ; s running the house , and she &amp; apos ; s looking for the paper , and the poem is going through her , and she &amp; apos ; s doing a pen just as she &amp; apos ; s walking through her , and then -- she said -- it &amp; apos ; s as if she &amp; apos ; s going to attack her other hand , and he &amp; apos ; s going to get it .
i committed myself to the place and the place against his brother and his father -- in the words , &amp; quot ; well , my proposal is this : tony &amp; apos ; s going to speak , we &amp; apos ; ll get him a device , and we &amp; apos ; ll find a way to make his art again .
and if i put another half together , we don &amp; apos ; t even see one more unit , which is circle , circle , and , but we see one unit , we don &amp; apos ; t see three parts , one circle , another .
and that &amp; apos ; s where they &amp; apos ; re also called out by my general doctor , so he can see where my weight problem is , not just at the moment in which i need cardiology or whatever , but also with a look at the past .
i don &amp; apos ; t have to feel emotional , because right around the corner there &amp; apos ; s always a different crazy , colorful , radiant , visible light of the outlet that &amp; apos ; s waiting for me if i &amp; apos ; m in love a little bit in the heart , and i &amp; apos ; m looking for it .
something interesting happened in &amp; quot ; abyss &amp; quot ; : to solve a narrower problem in this movie -- and that &amp; apos ; s because we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we had to take computer animation , cg , back .
and then there &amp; apos ; s also things that have come along that have been completely natural in life , which most people don &amp; apos ; t realize , for example , the detergent enzymes that allow us to wash their laundry at four degrees of laundry , are also genetically engineered enzymes .
and it &amp; apos ; s very amazing because you actually believe that this high technology that you &amp; apos ; re going to see is actually bringing you into the future , but in fact it &amp; apos ; s because the future is right for us , with our archaeal roots .
now , what &amp; apos ; s fascinating is that the tactile of carbon that &amp; apos ; s contained in liane , mao ##AT##-##AT## hi<unk> , are the very nature of the very same species that need the trending to allow the trustamines . so you ask yourself .
the last example that i &amp; apos ; ve got to show you today is a music sequence for live tracking that we &amp; apos ; ve recently developed and operate in the sidelines as sounds like leadership , bass and sleeve .
because i believe that the interactive media in us can address autism , cognitive models , thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time ago , and that we can reshape them with interactive media .
because the moment i turn my hand away , so you can see it from the back , this finger is moving , my finger is just from where it was , in a position where it &amp; apos ; s so extended .
when the golfer had been sold to the worst retailer , they found that the profits went up by 87 percent -- a result of the sales , the sales of sales and reducing cost .
and it &amp; apos ; s better , the things that you &amp; apos ; ve spent , and i &amp; apos ; ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd ##AT##-##AT## video and photo , libraries of books and music , technology , technology to medical diagnostics -- are now literally becoming materialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
what you have to do , it seems simple , but it &amp; apos ; s not . you &amp; apos ; d have to capture all the co2 that comes out of the burn after the kiln , capture , pressure under pressure and then store somewhere and hope that it &amp; apos ; s there .
now i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable now , but every year , it &amp; apos ; s too much my doubt .
as a result , he &amp; apos ; s now especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &amp; apos ; re sometimes so bad , and he &amp; apos ; s disappeared in the streets of skid row , and it &amp; apos ; s always the horror of his own mind .
so now , if i do this , the professionals in the crime scene , go to the crime scene , collect any hair samples , and then they turn it into this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this human being .
and it turns out that among 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &amp; apos ; s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &amp; apos ; s a large representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year .
i mean , if i &amp; apos ; m alone in the elevator , i &amp; apos ; m going to make all kinds of weird things , but then i &amp; apos ; m going to move on to other people , and i &amp; apos ; m listening to all these things because i don &amp; apos ; t want to mess them up , or frankly , they &amp; apos ; re going to mess .
i &amp; apos ; m happy to say that we don &amp; apos ; t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i spoke to a couple of years ago , who had brought a few sivia twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
to put these theories , let &amp; apos ; s remind ourselves that it &amp; apos ; s definitely a high school days , it &amp; apos ; s got to be a high target , and it &amp; apos ; s probably in iran , because most infections have been reported there .
that , as a translator , you don &amp; apos ; t just have to overtake the word for the text into a different language , but also understand the deeper sense of words and context , so that it makes a meaningful translation so that anyone knows what to do with foreign languages .
we took a p3 ##AT##-##AT## d camera , we put them apart , put them on a piece of light , and now we have a device that &amp; apos ; s free -- you can build it yourself , we provide the code for free , the software you can download free .
i &amp; apos ; m a creator of the house , so i &amp; apos ; m also involved in the theme of curiosity , and how the curiosity also changes our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity and have to reconnect and so on and so on .
it &amp; apos ; s -- what i &amp; apos ; ve done is i &amp; apos ; ve taken this code -- the code is made up of normal letters , which we use to symbolize -- and i &amp; apos ; ve written my allowance card on a piece of dna , and i &amp; apos ; ve increased it 10 ^ 22 times .
i met these guys at gral , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then to draw a laser pointer on it , which only registered the negative area .
