thank you for your patience .
dark matter . dark .
but the key thing is ...
these changes are coming in .
good afternoon , everybody .
here you see it now .
it &amp; apos ; s almost an identical structure .
but it gets worse than that .
is that your opinion ?
put out the camera .
next , nuclear energy .
yeah . all right .
after just a journey there .
maybe some mutations will perform .
and so it was .
her family gathered together .
he always showed up here .
they were still fish .
and i &amp; apos ; ve always had it .
the two people called me up .
very frightening .
i swear to him .
why should we do that ?
luckily , right ?
and then they set them up .
be a mentor .
it feels great .
urban is lupk .
and then it became international .
i was devastated .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange gene tractor .
... invent his own story .
so what &amp; apos ; s the point of hacking ?
labo , slowly .
it &amp; apos ; s against justice .
we &amp; apos ; re a smaller brand .
here &amp; apos ; s the city .
first extension , second extension .
and then everybody went down .
he loved it very much .
but it was very sad .
and that worked very well .
and it got even better .
the power station can explode .
in china , it was different .
that &amp; apos ; s a great question .
my name is amin .
and it took 18 months .
just keep on going . a lot of fun .
the answer to that is no .
okay , a few more .
there was remixing .
leave us alone .
so what happened years after that ?
am i going to like the color ?
but we need it all .
we say in germany , sustainability .
that &amp; apos ; s because you can train .
what would all have to be done ?
i wanted to support them .
he pointed to the algae .
they want to feed the world ?
and why is that ?
yeah , here it is .
he had the experience .
there &amp; apos ; s an old study .
and here &amp; apos ; s a surprise .
they have so much uncertainty .
some have come and gone .
who is the most successful one ?
these days are over .
privacy needs to be given .
they sell certified certified kate .
these people deserve money .
there are online criminals .
what happened here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
what creates the illusion ?
is it even photography ?
my gut feeling again .
he &amp; apos ; s my grandfather .
what happened here ?
how interested they are .
but you know what ?
first of all , narrow .
can we change it ?
this is the last one .
what are media today ?
anybody see anything ?
we can do it differently .
and it has to go back .
do you get this curious ?
you compare comparisons .
an autistic student .
and i was an artist .
that &amp; apos ; s a wish .
dg : thank you .
why do we do that ?
because you know what ?
how do we know that ?
so it &amp; apos ; s true .
dk : 60,000 .
i mean the soul .
all i &amp; apos ; m interested in .
that &amp; apos ; s all it &amp; apos ; s doing .
robert gupta .
what did they do ?
there &amp; apos ; s no food .
can i be honest ?
sounds familiar , what ?
what was the result ?
and i understand that .
people were playing crazy .
the data came in .
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
i created one .
that &amp; apos ; s exciting .
oh , so .
a few more .
maybe 10 times as many .
he opens the door .
why no longer live ?
who are those relatives ?
thank you very much .
italy wins . yeah .
here &amp; apos ; s the video .
i felt awe .
you could see manhattan .
so they knew everything .
jk : both .
it keeps you fresh .
i don &amp; apos ; t think so .
isn &amp; apos ; t that amazing ?
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
and that &amp; apos ; s important .
but i continued to work .
don &amp; apos ; t be daunting .
yeah , that &amp; apos ; s what goes on .
why does this happen at all ?
you see it immediately .
let &amp; apos ; s call him don &amp; apos ; t .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t happen very often .
it &amp; apos ; s not a country .
i have a question .
they use their hands .
there are two possibilities .
i think that &amp; apos ; s interesting .
that &amp; apos ; s very good .
somehow that doesn &amp; apos ; t work .
what do you want to do ?
so let &amp; apos ; s see .
who will make it safe ?
players don &amp; apos ; t sit around .
i think that &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
i think that &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
i &amp; apos ; ll stop that .
let me tell you .
we &amp; apos ; re constantly hitting each other .
it &amp; apos ; s not toxic in it .
what is the soul ?
i go in here .
it might sound bad .
i can say anything .
play is not silly .
ooh , thank you .
you can go inside .
i stood up to him .
she did it secretly .
that would have been okay .
let me wrap up .
so how does this work ?
i thought about it .
what do these people need ?
i learned everything .
sleep deprivation is ubiquitous .
he actually collected fish .
i wonder .
so they can do that .
it comes from conflicts of creativity .
so where do we go ?
oh . a moment .
okay . thank you .
here &amp; apos ; s an example .
so she was back .
and i continued to work .
this is what &amp; apos ; s happening to us today .
that &amp; apos ; s our present .
isn &amp; apos ; t that sad ?
we were 20 people .
that &amp; apos ; s the system .
farm is incredible .
we need energy miracle .
that &amp; apos ; s great .
it &amp; apos ; s a crisis .
there &amp; apos ; s no normal thing .
we can do that .
thank you very much .
they even hurt .
yeah , good day .
thank you for listening .
not school management .
nothing &amp; apos ; s happening at all .
yeah , good day .
what a fish .
that &amp; apos ; s actually me .
what about longevity ?
they &amp; apos ; re all important .
it &amp; apos ; s genetic .
so they meet al .
give her a return .
and she did .
i have children .
what do you say ?
but the wrong things .
the whole environmental debate .
yeah , milliseconds .
they have similar principles .
good work ! yes !
this happened at christmas .
just make your job .
i &amp; apos ; m a writer .
this was the result .
very expensive real estate .
and he says ...
a few less .
that &amp; apos ; s us .
it has sensors .
after a week .
that was incredible .
thank you .
yeah . okay .
i was amazed .
are they all ?
hhh .
we were poor .
centers were built up .
that &amp; apos ; s not ...
solar technology is ...
we love innovation .
the sun rises .
we love entertainment .
music as a language .
handing them up .
come on .
completely inefficient .
an enormous challenge .
thank you .
... not yet .
it &amp; apos ; s hard .
yeah , hello .
we know that .
because that &amp; apos ; s what singing .
they need time .
that &amp; apos ; s fast .
here it is .
not very sustainable .
ta ##AT##-##AT## da !
very different term .
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
that &amp; apos ; s wrong .
that &amp; apos ; s efficient .
it &amp; apos ; s awful .
it &amp; apos ; s essential .
it &amp; apos ; s scary .
i &amp; apos ; m tom .
thank you .
don &amp; apos ; t find anything .
thank you very much .
a lot of stuff .
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
we lose them .
we &amp; apos ; re going to lift .
fantastic , right ?
the only chance .
or before bombs .
no hospital .
it &amp; apos ; s interesting .
but it goes .
that was fascinating .
it works like this .
sounds good ?
i can help .
oh my god !
what does that mean ?
where do you go ?
oh my god .
for a long time , yeah .
yeah , so .
thank you . thank you .
three out of 10 .
is that reasonable ?
what does that mean ?
seriously .
it &amp; apos ; s incredibly exciting .
thank you .
thank you .
great trick ?
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
maybe not .
thank you .
thank you .
f.
shit .
ol√© !
stephen watts .
thank you .
that &amp; apos ; s true .
that &amp; apos ; s it .
1.5 million .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it &amp; apos ; s all about it .
one ?
thank you .
flying cat .
thank you .
thank you .
is it going to happen ?
thank you .
thank you .
whoa !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
hold twice .
well , yeah .
pretty simple .
positive .
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah ?
60,000 .
creativity .
yeah !
thank you .
okay .
fantastic .
yeah .
unique .
yeah ?
yeah ?
sustainable .
yeah ?
yeah ?
yeah ?
that &amp; apos ; s it .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ?
why ?
hello !
it &amp; apos ; s about .
wow !
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
really .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah ?
yeah ?
yeah ?
yeah ?
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
what takes five milliseconds ?
meanwhile , the instruments have continued to evolve .
or take a lip pen .
tell them what they feel .
anyway , not to navigate .
but really , really effective , right ?
the reasons to write it .
i hope you will forgive me .
they literally reversed the lever .
this is an ecologist network .
i remember my first fire .
monday : color is something powerful .
just be who you are .
politely , they all applaud .
so , meaning , not so optimistic .
that sounds kind of unusual .
the truth is more like this .
third , scale of expectations .
they &amp; apos ; re all appealing questions .
the official dogma of what ?
you can &amp; apos ; t do anything like that .
now look at this curve .
so scott gets this fruition .
he died , broken through history .
he moved into silence .
the white lines represent the population .
you should wish you .
i started with my usual talk .
i &amp; apos ; m talking a lot about these questions .
today it &amp; apos ; s 2.3 million .
this may be publicly transmitted public .
now we &amp; apos ; re going to do this with airplanes .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
something very strange is happening here .
and that &amp; apos ; s nothing yet .
i believed anybody could .
i &amp; apos ; ve never met him personally .
we need to grow complexity slowly .
we &amp; apos ; ve gone into an area of danger .
and he showed him ja4 .
they basically do the same thing .
you see something fun here .
this is now one of the images .
the pieces are very good .
completely targeted for a particular goal .
this picture is from this place .
and then something funny happened .
i started a institute there .
everybody &amp; apos ; s talking about happiness today .
that &amp; apos ; s cool , right ?
let &amp; apos ; s face it -- who &amp; apos ; s normal ?
so this crazy story could be true .
because does anybody have matures here ?
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
there &amp; apos ; s almost nothing left .
that &amp; apos ; s a natural thing .
and we &amp; apos ; re very happy about it .
he was already more than a sixth .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
and we &amp; apos ; re too many .
it &amp; apos ; s completely trivial .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
so the question is : how ?
a has these benefits and risks .
they grow five inches in size .
but there are two problems .
i started feeling better .
but , you know what ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
she did it for three years .
let &amp; apos ; s talk about water wars .
that was grandiose .
so what &amp; apos ; s next step ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
so i followed my gut feeling .
no , no one had ever been an opportunity .
the story isn &amp; apos ; t over yet .
what happened that day ?
so we measured his movement .
you can be logically and intuitively be .
she was back , and she was dying .
and this video is real time .
the data wasn &amp; apos ; t available before .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
now , how did this happen ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
so , we can do that as well .
they &amp; apos ; re creating an epic story .
it &amp; apos ; s a completely different term .
they haven &amp; apos ; t changed the story .
if you burn coal , no .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
they can play with different kinds of things .
the whole building was water .
and that was 19 years ago .
which one would you like the most ?
happiness . fantastic !
and that &amp; apos ; s actually what he says .
and that got me so confused .
what should our testimony look like ?
it &amp; apos ; s a pretty crazy idea .
if you burn natural gas , no .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
a billion people are going to starve today .
that has to be the age of age .
so it &amp; apos ; s not like <unk> ox .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
the stones are color ##AT##-##AT## coded .
people were still happy .
it was my first sunburn .
my name is brian goldman .
she shares her experiences with others .
slowly but certainly it did .
this is how natural things are presented .
we all love baseball , right ?
we use the energy of the sun .
somehow , children don &amp; apos ; t do it anymore .
that &amp; apos ; s about five feet long .
they become computers in the free time .
other things shouldn &amp; apos ; t suffer .
that &amp; apos ; s why i made the movie .
it &amp; apos ; s just not technological .
and you already have a problem .
he automatically goes to the right thought .
the emergency staff moved all the strands .
okay , that &amp; apos ; s really about courage .
and it was an incredible experience .
i don &amp; apos ; t take the same process .
and that doesn &amp; apos ; t tell us much .
we didn &amp; apos ; t write this app .
they didn &amp; apos ; t give up the government .
that &amp; apos ; s it , very simple .
here &amp; apos ; s a description of the street .
and that &amp; apos ; s what we did .
it &amp; apos ; s meant to fill in the experience .
this is ideology , not science .
let &amp; apos ; s make a little bundle .
here you have this little mechanism .
that &amp; apos ; s where he signed up .
i &amp; apos ; m going to show you that now .
you can &amp; apos ; t have insurance .
the students are divided into notes .
it &amp; apos ; s interested in firemen .
i probably shouldn &amp; apos ; t do that .
we can &amp; apos ; t just do that .
what are you trying to do ? &amp; quot ;
this is all metadata .
i got a little scared of technology .
there &amp; apos ; s also world record .
somehow that doesn &amp; apos ; t work , right ?
i &amp; apos ; m going to stand you a little bit .
i &amp; apos ; ve talked a lot about magic .
further than we don &amp; apos ; t .
that wouldn &amp; apos ; t have been a problem .
i wanted to be normal at that time .
that &amp; apos ; s not necessarily something bad .
creativity had to somehow stop .
this is god , you know ?
let &amp; apos ; s start with sunday .
who doesn &amp; apos ; t want healthier kids ?
we &amp; apos ; ve reached a kind of balance .
and the shape plays a role .
so paul is a terrorist .
don &amp; apos ; t think of anything as giving up .
so that &amp; apos ; s the good news .
there &amp; apos ; s no problem to be .
it just wasn &amp; apos ; t invented yet .
otherwise you can &amp; apos ; t have teeth .
it &amp; apos ; s not usually the route .
i think it &amp; apos ; s disgusting .
at first , we just signed up .
today , it &amp; apos ; s all easy to have .
the living people gave up the spirits .
once upon a time , we started a living .
we &amp; apos ; ve actually redefined poverty .
they are an inspiring personality .
it &amp; apos ; s not our burden .
my brother starved at me .
who would ever wish for a wish ?
it &amp; apos ; s dealing with misdirection .
we need to think about what brands are .
we won a few prizes .
the morning before the game .
but i don &amp; apos ; t buy anything new .
play doesn &amp; apos ; t just mean child games .
no one has ever said that before .
i mean , i &amp; apos ; m a journalist .
that &amp; apos ; s why it &amp; apos ; s a big challenge .
they &amp; apos ; re horrifying . &amp; quot ;
and of course , it &amp; apos ; s incredibly busy .
okay , there are a few .
so basically a translation of translation .
if that &amp; apos ; s the waste at the moment .
and it starts with a doctor .
and there are hundreds of them .
but it doesn &amp; apos ; t go so fast .
well , then we want to go .
who do you really want to inform ?
they &amp; apos ; re actually providing funding with it .
maybe i shouldn &amp; apos ; t say that .
i &amp; apos ; m shooting through my head a little bit .
so let me remind you .
everybody needs a goldfish boat .
it &amp; apos ; s sort of , you know .
what &amp; apos ; s the thing ?
g.pee &amp; apos ; s chance .
nfl missions , right ?
so there are two cycles of wire .
have you ever been geologically ?
and how did that feel ?
they could have done better than that .
my wife told me .
now there &amp; apos ; s a third sentence .
again , you have it again .
thank you for your attention .
2,5 to one , great .
so they saw something magic .
architects and engineers , fortunately .
so i tried something a little bit more exciting .
what does a story look like ?
oversimplified technology .
that &amp; apos ; s it .
wonderful , right ?
what about fitness ?
it sounds frightening .
what actually happened ?
it &amp; apos ; s also a very exciting phenomenon .
imagine mozart efficiently .
it really changed the dynamic .
and finally , epic meaning .
is it all just education ?
what else is risky ?
hmmm , my brand ?
one is south korea .
i don &amp; apos ; t have to worry .
lego made it possible for everyone .
they went through each other .
we can recover our nutrients .
we &amp; apos ; ve built unique elements here .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
these rivers are getting too rapid .
this picture reminded me of something .
this is a game outside .
for example , this perception in context .
anybody know what this is ?
we depend on two countries .
and that &amp; apos ; s what we &amp; apos ; re doing .
so the correlation is low .
the byproduct is clean water .
because to me , it means memory .
the mechanism is from lie .
they always say , why ?
it &amp; apos ; s going to take place next april .
the chef had cooked it .
i almost never cook with it .
the same thing , just bigger .
this is a dead turtle .
our magazines are read by millions .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
well , i was the next one .
and women argued that successfully .
the game begins -- silence .
they saw the big beat .
that was the beginning of the journey .
it switches down the engines .
i really like beautiful clothes .
tell me about this world .
i see this plume .
think about your own decisions .
her mother moved on alone .
sometimes i &amp; apos ; m too tempted .
they were genetically exterminated .
that was more to the concrete .
you can see that down there .
why not think that way ?
here &amp; apos ; s another example .
we go through rituals of rituals .
privacy is not about debate .
the only country in the world .
and this opens up a map .
that made me really sad .
they look like this .
is it about the light ?
they come from the artists .
it seemed quite popular .
i grew up in india .
what other brands are doing ?
you see the water coming .
you can have this cloud .
and it depends on phosphorus .
every waste is nutrients .
most people know this .
and here &amp; apos ; s the representation again .
it was really profound .
we need to spread the news .
the data shows it all the time .
embarrassing . shame .
but it didn &amp; apos ; t have that .
sounds crazy , right ?
will it have my size ?
it &amp; apos ; s very risky .
what do i look at ?
but what do we do about it ?
my cousins walked all over the place .
we lost contact .
so , what does that mean ?
she connected these two people .
i lived in parallel worlds .
have you seen these guys ?
it has billions of these .
but they do the job .
i &amp; apos ; ll never forget it .
i &amp; apos ; ll never forget that .
it &amp; apos ; s going to touch you deeply .
crisis . death . disaster .
and a lot of people forget this .
i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
you &amp; apos ; re always losing rare animals .
we have three main groups .
now , what does that mean ?
i wanted to be healthy .
do you want jeans with holes ?
how do we actually work people ?
he &amp; apos ; s not going to do it .
but where are we useful ?
the work of interpretations .
they were running the canals .
but what do your fish eat ?
that &amp; apos ; s a lot of volume .
it was a huge success .
and then realizing it .
what do you think happened now ?
it &amp; apos ; s called paul offer .
that &amp; apos ; s not true of emotions .
the game is from 2007 .
i want to ask you something .
that &amp; apos ; s it . thank you .
let &amp; apos ; s call him don &amp; apos ; t .
i don &amp; apos ; t like that question .
it &amp; apos ; s been up all the time .
first , we have the population .
i had a good life .
that &amp; apos ; s the short term .
this is what the chart looked like .
and there &amp; apos ; s good news .
asked the nurse .
and fortunately he didn &amp; apos ; t die .
you also have to understand that .
it &amp; apos ; s getting more and more like that .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t taste very well .
you don &amp; apos ; t want to do that ?
his name is temple .
that &amp; apos ; s intentional .
that &amp; apos ; s about it .
what else can we do ?
he &amp; apos ; s the guy on the left .
we can &amp; apos ; t get rid of it .
they didn &amp; apos ; t have books .
you can &amp; apos ; t have bone .
today &amp; apos ; s project carriers .
you can &amp; apos ; t store energy .
i &amp; apos ; ll get to the end .
maybe that &amp; apos ; s the reality .
so i went to court .
once the judge saw me .
these things are logical .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we &amp; apos ; re no longer producing ourselves .
i don &amp; apos ; t think so .
we love technology and creativity .
he went up and down .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i wouldn &amp; apos ; t recommend it .
this is the memory sink .
this is felix .
but it &amp; apos ; s not protection .
because i can say anything .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
i just loved two .
what are the lessons we learned ?
this has the biggest impact .
so what do we need to do ?
and that &amp; apos ; s pretty amazing .
i agree with them .
it would be knowledge .
or is it possible ?
that &amp; apos ; s a great question .
here &amp; apos ; s another example .
but it requires a lot of planning .
there &amp; apos ; s something else .
it &amp; apos ; s not our problem .
it &amp; apos ; s not our fight .
it would be intolerable .
my second mistake was worse .
the other one was very strong diarrhea .
but it &amp; apos ; s not being documented .
they didn &amp; apos ; t have mass media .
we &amp; apos ; re too many .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t have that soul .
i want to help you calm down .
so that &amp; apos ; s how the supermarket is .
so lickbits is open source .
but i asked myself these questions .
and that &amp; apos ; s what i felt .
then he whispered to me .
scott signed up by man .
it may take until it &amp; apos ; s uploaded .
loans and sponsors were searching .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
now , this cartoon does some statements .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
thursday : confidence is the key .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they &amp; apos ; re both survival , they &amp; apos ; re light .
i tried to preserve the body .
they divided the kingdom into two halves .
that &amp; apos ; s the truth . i think that &amp; apos ; s what i believe .
and there &amp; apos ; s a lot of collaborators .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
you can jump directly to a particular issue .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
that &amp; apos ; s how you feel . &amp; quot ;
we now have maps in this country .
anybody ever know what that is ?
we &amp; apos ; ve <unk> ded them . we &amp; apos ; ve got them .
we need to use more research for more research .
the internet and services are a miracle .
my grandparents urged that number to 70 .
these were the very first computations six years ago .
it &amp; apos ; s a very nice story , as i think .
so it &amp; apos ; s circle .
to say , what &amp; apos ; s information ?
his whole process of work has changed .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
and this picture was taken by atlas .
they increase paralysis , and they reduce happiness .
they have them . they always have them .
we still think they &amp; apos ; re original .
it &amp; apos ; s about changing north ##AT##-##AT## based values .
they kept us from being inspired .
here &amp; apos ; s two different smudges .
i think that &amp; apos ; s really cool .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
the main man was waving me .
what do you think happens next ?
the headquarters for corporate headquarters are right here .
he shook his head , no .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
we already have 20 percent in germany .
it &amp; apos ; s a dairy , right .
this is a year &amp; apos ; s water flow .
you &amp; apos ; re worried about it that we &amp; apos ; re getting worse .
we think of energy today .
that &amp; apos ; s where jimmy kramel came .
the amount of water has expanded .
so from modern in the computer society .
you can dive into a particular year .
say there &amp; apos ; s no previous failure .
they &amp; apos ; re all over the place , almost .
but with the right design , here we go .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
we can support them to be good .
we can support them to be good .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
i &amp; apos ; m looking at the datatin .
so what are we going to end up with ?
and that &amp; apos ; s what they do .
so , that was my primary motivation .
now i &amp; apos ; m going to add one more bass .
we need to get far , fast .
if you don &amp; apos ; t , somebody else is torturing you today .
this is the machine below geneva .
they were laughing more than they were doing here .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
wittlement is just about our lives .
the first one is a classic , apple .
i &amp; apos ; m a redundant person .
so again , that really fit quite well .
so that made sense , it fit together .
but how do you do that in practice ?
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
that &amp; apos ; s about one percent of the population .
it &amp; apos ; s just the test of survival and success .
hhh , wickww !
we get a perfectly flat line about that .
i would normally take the needle out .
well , then i &amp; apos ; ll show you .
the guy in the middle doesn &amp; apos ; t do that much .
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
they derive the process , they understand it .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
and what do you do with the waste ?
they &amp; apos ; re getting less trouble because we &amp; apos ; re catching them .
have a nice example of that .
so don &amp; apos ; t save , don &amp; apos ; t prevent , don &amp; apos ; t prevent .
because that &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s happening , right ?
and there &amp; apos ; s a central point .
it &amp; apos ; s a new supply of america .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
in other areas -- the world of communications .
it &amp; apos ; s not a decision between privacy and safety .
i have nothing to hide . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s not just a crazy idea .
what you need is a new medical culture .
it &amp; apos ; s the average performance of the bat .
yet we seem to be quite pleased with it .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
how do i get it away ? &amp; quot ;
life had not changed for centuries .
well , it was friday , that &amp; apos ; s true .
in 2010 , it had been seen as 23 million times .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
i work in the solar technology industry .
how can we help you ? &amp; quot ;
and here &amp; apos ; s every piece that &amp; apos ; s very planned very well .
but so many people got help over the years .
someone did an old ##AT##-##AT## fashioned version of it .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
eeeeg ! no , thank you .
tell me a little bit about that part .
you &amp; apos ; re going to tell me something about my brand .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
make it possible -- everybody here .
it &amp; apos ; s called the cloud -- the cloud .
here &amp; apos ; s how the building works .
so that &amp; apos ; s the reason for this project .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
tuesday : adaptation is being totally overrated .
thank you , danny kahman .
i was so thrilled with science , you know .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
many of my colleagues are very young .
most of all , if it &amp; apos ; s already died , it &amp; apos ; s mostly .
it &amp; apos ; s not supposed to be compost , of course .
there &amp; apos ; s every footprint on it .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
but you can &amp; apos ; t replace phosphorus .
and we see that it &amp; apos ; s quite successful .
schtz the environment , make less garbage .
it &amp; apos ; s also a paradigm shift .
and they &amp; apos ; re also feeling their movements and their tendency .
it &amp; apos ; s just breathtaking .
this is the primary mechanism of evolution here .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
yeah . it does nothing but discovery .
now this level of intuition is very important .
the three words are : remember ?
i &amp; apos ; m happy i &amp; apos ; m there .
we &amp; apos ; ve been playing crash since 1994 .
states of these kinds don &amp; apos ; t exist with us .
i call this the bright tiger .
which words would you describe ?
the movie hasn &amp; apos ; t been delivered yet .
that &amp; apos ; s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
and i &amp; apos ; d like to read it to you .
we &amp; apos ; ve done a lot of work .
do you want to get there and listen ? &amp; quot ;
and no one seems to rain about that .
as we think from the north .
but that doesn &amp; apos ; t have to be the end .
no , i mean it really is serious .
it &amp; apos ; s just an insurance method .
if that doesn &amp; apos ; t work , what happens ?
what are the things i appeal to ?
we have something that doesn &amp; apos ; t go up .
it &amp; apos ; s the most powerful human trait .
and then he can walk away .
no , no , no , it can &amp; apos ; t .
asking what &amp; apos ; s the right thing to do ?
i don &amp; apos ; t know who knows .
this is where he &amp; apos ; s putting the sun up .
we want to do something about death penalty .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
i pulled him out here in particular .
the question is , what &amp; apos ; s next ?
i tried to understand them .
very simple , that &amp; apos ; s how it &amp; apos ; s going to happen .
and that argument doesn &amp; apos ; t make sense .
if you haven &amp; apos ; t heard it yet .
they &amp; apos ; re gone . they &amp; apos ; ve disappeared .
they don &amp; apos ; t spend time in power fights .
i &amp; apos ; ll start with a couple of simple examples .
so growth rate itself is speeding up .
it &amp; apos ; s all compost from it .
thank you , but that &amp; apos ; s the best part .
for energy , it occurred to me .
but i &amp; apos ; m going to ask you a question .
we don &amp; apos ; t like to talk about our story .
we don &amp; apos ; t really know very much about it .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
i &amp; apos ; m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
it all comes from our own pockets .
because we don &amp; apos ; t want to push the genes around ?
there &amp; apos ; s a lot that needs to come together .
and there &amp; apos ; s the storage problem .
do we really want to go this way ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
these are going to be in<unk> able .
but what will come in the future ?
people were suffering . people were fighting .
five million people use it every month .
daniel khyhman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
i &amp; apos ; m holding the knife in my hand .
it has nothing to do with science .
we &amp; apos ; re talking a little bit about it later .
and that can make a big difference .
you see the timeline on the top .
that &amp; apos ; s really cool . &amp; quot ;
i could draw . i could paint .
so i &amp; apos ; ll stop , thank you very much .
now i see great moon .
wicked ? i was completely confused .
they have the flow of water vice versa .
in the presumption of maybe two percent .
music is medicine . music changes us .
how far do you get there ?
so the first step into interpretation .
when you get to that , right ?
and every morning i &amp; apos ; m going to go into it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
often in the third one , forget about it again .
maybe again , you have to look back at it .
i &amp; apos ; d like to show you that .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
so we damaged about 50 of these magnets .
but today we are far beyond that .
what do you do with certified <unk> ships ?
i thought i could integrate myself .
it was a grouper .
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
because we live on a planet of water .
the thing that &amp; apos ; s just been presented .
my fourth technology : <unk> tional complexity .
this is an image of the object .
you want to orient yourself in the museum ?
you walk around and you amuse yourself .
how would you describe your brand ?
it &amp; apos ; s a whole bowl of cool white food .
he can only use his eyes .
and that was the eruption of the outbreak .
but the truth is far from it .
you can do this all the time .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
a little bit closer to me .
all adults were conscious of the risks .
even cats are looking at this video .
third technology : categorization .
now we saw the reverse effect .
i like things that are different .
they brought their pictures , right ?
we talk about bold , fresh .
i went to prison -- hard .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
i &amp; apos ; ll read you the post .
so the first exciting primate .
we worked till late at night .
we dismiss engineered food .
anyway , we need a solution .
it &amp; apos ; s sort of shortened us .
so i just started playing .
and then we said , okay .
we also got very precise data .
yeah , that &amp; apos ; s the data .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
you know what &amp; apos ; s common ?
how did he feel about it ?
it makes leukemia in children .
she wasn &amp; apos ; t even drunk .
you can show , i was there .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
you &amp; apos ; ll see from the back to the front .
the book and the picture .
it was a pretty fond project .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
seriously -- the dawn of extinction !
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we started this 15 years ago .
and there are several reasons for this .
156 nations send our tv channel .
they tap into their internet connection .
we can reinvent everything else .
i &amp; apos ; m the new defined doctor .
alone , shame and without support .
why did i go to medicine ?
that i had written these crazy things .
i &amp; apos ; m giving people death cells .
the silence is oars .
it can know where we are .
and these are the neural structures .
this is a modest little app .
but it has an unexpected twist .
the defeat would be too easy .
i &amp; apos ; m getting tired , as we all do .
and yet it &amp; apos ; s still not interpretation .
so every concert is a different concert .
no tree is carbon neutral .
that &amp; apos ; s just a little less destruction .
that &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s called the <unk> model .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
you &amp; apos ; re the home countries of somebody .
there can be a sequence of changes .
they gave her blood pressure .
and we keep increasing our expectations all the time .
child mortality is down by a tenth .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
so it &amp; apos ; s right in the middle .
i think our identity is threatened .
these are the aphias .
and that worked . applause for scott .
no one needs to give up your ideas of green light .
oh my god . oh my god .
here &amp; apos ; s her marinatra trust .
and i &amp; apos ; ve never seen them .
and it &amp; apos ; s also very risky .
it didn &amp; apos ; t make sense in my eyes .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
here you see roberto dancing .
this is a picture of a circle of circular .
the difference then is perceived as loss .
and she &amp; apos ; s beating a 257 .
notice two things on this curve .
but maybe that &amp; apos ; s not the case .
it &amp; apos ; s a very sensitive question .
we &amp; apos ; ve seen some fantastic presentations .
storytelling always takes more senses .
so there &amp; apos ; s a disconnect coming out .
oh , my time is over ?
here &amp; apos ; s the olive oil .
well , that &amp; apos ; s not really right .
let &amp; apos ; s think about the atoms .
but reality is always unpredictable .
it was born four and a half years ago in italy .
and you know what i learned ?
unfortunately , it &amp; apos ; s not much better .
that &amp; apos ; s one and a half billion players .
and that &amp; apos ; s a very simple question .
i &amp; apos ; m pushing my sleeve back .
it &amp; apos ; s kind of like a potato .
and everyone in this room has to go inside .
but there &amp; apos ; s another reason .
it should have contained the two elements .
it really solves the fuel problem .
the dosage also has a role .
who could have predicted all this ?
motors , powered -- four possibilities .
it &amp; apos ; s really appalling thousands of square miles .
but then they really want to go deep .
okay , you really want to know that ?
this is a child &amp; apos ; s game , right ?
and i had to get away from the city .
and no matter , italy ended up winning .
let &amp; apos ; s begin to perceive it .
we can give ourselves something like this .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
for a year , we didn &amp; apos ; t have a cents .
and the goal is very simple .
the result of that was <unk> phal .
it &amp; apos ; s not even the truth that &amp; apos ; s going to release them .
and even lobo thinks about it .
moreover , these sources are intertwined .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
so this was a very strange experience .
i fell in love with this fish .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and this sounds very different than it did before .
and that &amp; apos ; s at the very beginning .
they &amp; apos ; re just better than reality .
so , look what happens .
so that &amp; apos ; s a tough one .
it &amp; apos ; s like listening to speech .
that &amp; apos ; s just the minimum amount .
so you can &amp; apos ; t solve that .
so men can &amp; apos ; t be pigs .
people are talking about the urine .
and it &amp; apos ; s all packaging or content .
and curiosity doesn &amp; apos ; t learn .
it just has to process this as a present .
that ecology is a global issue .
i mean , everybody &amp; apos ; s eaten cake .
it &amp; apos ; s longer than those two networks .
a language is expression of the human mind .
bundbine sundin .
all of these are unavoidable .
and that &amp; apos ; s the crux .
maybe i did it with good reasons .
we live in a truly extraordinary time .
i learned this from my grandmother .
it &amp; apos ; s expanding fast .
the bank is from another place .
her father died shortly after she was born .
in the countries where people get money .
that means that the ants weigh much more than us .
you &amp; apos ; ve seen it warm in the news .
... crowdsourcing it .
this is an idea worth spreading .
we called it the digital water pavion .
anyway . i definitely want that .
the answer is yes .
next week , it &amp; apos ; s on the market .
and i went back to work .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and try it again with another generation .
now we &amp; apos ; re going to do this with drilling and machines .
she had the last word in any family fight .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
my uncle died of alcohol induced pluripotent diseases .
and then i wonder , how did this happen ?
30 years ago , it would have been ridiculous .
i hired her , and i went to the treatment .
and you &amp; apos ; re asking , what happens to these moments ?
so the theme of the day : saving money .
and that &amp; apos ; s what these brands have done .
so i think that &amp; apos ; s my brand .
in fact , no , it wasn &amp; apos ; t the mistake at all .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
what do you think the answer will be ?
on the left ##AT##-##AT## hand side , you see a little boat .
well , we introduced the mayor of bellows .
that &amp; apos ; s why i think we need to be leaders .
i &amp; apos ; m not sure where we go .
and that &amp; apos ; s actually a conservative estimate .
the audience &amp; apos ; s faces were very serious and careful .
what happened was we could do that .
this has to go down to the bottom , to zero .
the best part is -- in a second .
here we are , and this is the painting .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of crazy things going on .
it was something we knew we knew to do .
it &amp; apos ; s something like our fight .
so i spoke a couple of months later at a conference .
how do you judge people because of their personality ?
you expect another billion players in the next decade .
people come into the side of the room right now .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it &amp; apos ; s a complete denial of errors .
also , the energy price for you is very important .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
it &amp; apos ; s hard to overestimate the destruction .
and here you feel it .
picasso answered , wait .
now everybody &amp; apos ; s trying to see something out of this pattern .
now i &amp; apos ; m going to do some other stuff with that .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
the question is why people accept that .
if you generalize it , that &amp; apos ; s what happens .
and that &amp; apos ; s the planning behind stuxnet .
and we use this word of contempt .
good night , cute marsupial rat . &amp; quot ;
rat ? yeah . alive ? yap .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
i &amp; apos ; ve done my job at 60 pounds .
the underwater part comes out of a quarry .
and i see the same process with photographs .
is this about the details or the colors ?
i think maybe i &amp; apos ; ve heard more hands .
you know how many people are watching these tedtalks ?
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
so each droplet was a little bit different .
imagine a sound <unk> less aircraft .
internal sexuality comes in a lot of different shapes .
so keep your shoes on ; save your shoes .
we &amp; apos ; ve been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is create the future .
i mean , that &amp; apos ; s a real cognitive trap .
let me show you it from near .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
they were just like the people in this room .
di<unk> , romans , child paralysis , child paralysis .
there &amp; apos ; s a connection , a different respect .
we understood that the weather is global .
we don &amp; apos ; t want companies to patent life .
well , i understand . i do .
so my two passions were sort of intertwined .
do you do that for the kids ? &amp; quot ;
every morning , they fly 240 miles to the farm .
no one &amp; apos ; s ever done that in the world .
interpretation is barely spoken in early education .
it &amp; apos ; s such a tragic part .
it &amp; apos ; s all that &amp; apos ; s in it that &amp; apos ; s useful .
no , we &amp; apos ; re holding what &amp; apos ; s inside .
how can i make some user use ?
you know , science is not a company .
if your job is dancing , dance .
and they had to remove them , which is what we did .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
and i get a character in the book .
they &amp; apos ; re versaic and strange programs .
it also shows up in other places of the book .
so it &amp; apos ; s meant to come from the outside to the people .
i &amp; apos ; m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
so , mass forces us to escape the technology .
but that wasn &amp; apos ; t the end of the rats .
he hasn &amp; apos ; t come out in other countries yet .
i didn &amp; apos ; t want to go ; i love my life .
so they communicate -- this is how their fingers walk along .
and they &amp; apos ; re not just going to die on mayors .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
and that &amp; apos ; s why it &amp; apos ; s not seen as much loss .
an amazing error rate . one out of nine innocent .
here &amp; apos ; s how he highs a rare glider .
this year it &amp; apos ; s taken almost 50 million times .
it &amp; apos ; s taken almost 200 million times this year .
all the rest of the time , they &amp; apos ; re petrified .
just to precise times , they match their voices .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
now i &amp; apos ; m going to show you my favorite feature .
it &amp; apos ; s like i want to be .
the teachers didn &amp; apos ; t know that something was changed .
wouldn &amp; apos ; t it be nice to open your doors ?
there &amp; apos ; s somebody sitting in the back who didn &amp; apos ; t have childhood .
it &amp; apos ; s going to be a key element of this disease .
yeah , they &amp; apos ; re right . we &amp; apos ; re going to fix it .
another example is what &amp; apos ; s called virtual reality .
we learn trust and the rules of play .
we can continue these things in different examples .
and i went over and i just stopped .
in fact , bear did not want to make a viral video .
another favorite picture of me , starlight night .
many people talk about a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &amp; apos ; s all over here . it &amp; apos ; s all online .
i &amp; apos ; m very grateful for the catch here .
i said , &amp; quot ; what are you talking about ? &amp; quot ;
you don &amp; apos ; t talk about god and the nature of god .
today i &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
as a child , i recorded comic books all the time and so on .
but here &amp; apos ; s what you should have thought .
we don &amp; apos ; t know identity ; we invent them .
that &amp; apos ; s where our goal is now .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and what i &amp; apos ; m saying now is very important .
and we need to do a lot more on this device .
i &amp; apos ; m really sorry . is it crazy ?
my great ##AT##-##AT## grandparents all died when they were 60 .
it &amp; apos ; s really old , and it &amp; apos ; s done .
you know what it &amp; apos ; s like to call a 400,000 ##AT##-##AT## pound guy ?
i &amp; apos ; m an expert on relationships . &amp; quot ;
he &amp; apos ; s just deceiving them and not herself .
for example , the sneakers , right ?
but today we &amp; apos ; re only talking about biological systems .
there &amp; apos ; s no population problem with trees .
it would roll over the country .
yeah , i &amp; apos ; m afraid of all these things .
they &amp; apos ; re all back on their way .
here &amp; apos ; s a couple on the hamptons .
let them be kogi . &amp; quot ;
and of course , we all share the same adaptations .
these stupid movies don &amp; apos ; t bring us any money .
and we &amp; apos ; ve also seen this in mobile phones .
here &amp; apos ; s the chance to do something .
and i have to say , there was power .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
in one place , the screen is filled with leaves .
all of them were like this , and they began to divide .
boston is not just a call center in boston .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and then it &amp; apos ; s about the combination of different images .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
my mother was suffering from the boat on the boat .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about wine .
what &amp; apos ; s the foraging application ? &amp; quot ;
that &amp; apos ; s great , then we have a business model .
because we can &amp; apos ; t live without these lives .
from the volgt age to the machine age .
now he &amp; apos ; s catching a tractor into the scene .
it was way off , and i &amp; apos ; m freezing .
and it wasn &amp; apos ; t that hard to diagnose .
and this is very important in medical research .
and there &amp; apos ; s a very good reason for that too .
and yet it &amp; apos ; s a realistic level .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about anything .
because it doesn &amp; apos ; t feel real money .
i mean , no one &amp; apos ; s ever seen a particle .
and it &amp; apos ; s not just gender .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
i &amp; apos ; ll just say that &amp; apos ; s logical .
that &amp; apos ; s a problem that a lot of players have .
this player is about to be an episode in the face of an episode .
we got rid of what didn &amp; apos ; t work .
it &amp; apos ; s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we didn &amp; apos ; t have child paralysis in this country yesterday .
but you know what you don &amp; apos ; t have right ?
we pretend to have a machine here .
that means something that &amp; apos ; s built in the city .
my parents are the 80 on the heel .
have you taken all your vitamins this morning ?
what ? that really got me crazy .
and let &amp; apos ; s start with an example .
maybe we can see witch as a change .
raise your hands . let me see you .
how many would you decide for a good memory ?
i wanted to reconstitute the health of a disease .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
imagine that for a moment .
second time . end of normal time .
so you can understand the whole movement .
the flamgos eat the shrimp .
you just have to spread it as far as you possibly can .
no apple ever blew up again like this .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
store those abnormalities , dissolve the rest .
one of them thought i had kidney stones .
this is alfred gongonzz .
let me show you how they work .
you just listen , and then you start talking .
there are those who are much more spatial .
their problem is they have too little .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &amp; apos ; t poetry .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
logic doesn &amp; apos ; t matter what it is .
pat<unk> should still work .
technical cycles are the same .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
this is an entirely unsustainable pattern of development .
now , what &amp; apos ; s the archaeological models ?
so , just help me a little bit .
do you remember the windmill ?
and then , in general , it looks like this .
so , that really blew my mind .
and they fly 40 miles every night .
we asked around , and no one knew .
and we created an iphone app .
and the problem is not technology itself .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone .
america &amp; apos ; s new america . find out more .
new investments to create well ##AT##-##AT## paid jobs .
and you can continue the list .
and in that mind , memory was remembered .
now you &amp; apos ; re looking at the dmttin .
the environment , the less energy needs .
can you play it in blue now ?
everybody knew your genius was something lahm .
you get two because of it -- very simple .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
the decline of dna was an interesting step .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
and giving feedback back to my high school doctor .
i remember it was yesterday .
but these are all the streets in the u.s. .
this is footage from six seconds .
there were immense indicators of judaism in the control room .
and if you don &amp; apos ; t , don &amp; apos ; t keep your dance .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
i can adjust the sequence while it &amp; apos ; s happening .
i &amp; apos ; m looking forward to everybody &amp; apos ; s conversations .
anyway , they &amp; apos ; re doing it in there .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
this is being balanced in china in a second .
and i said in my youth , expectation .
his personal immigration of erotic erodes .
because artists have a malicious relationship with lie .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
all right , what &amp; apos ; s the brand germans ?
attorney : i &amp; apos ; m a company brand .
and that &amp; apos ; s great , because we need that .
it grows in the winter and shrinking in summer .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is an interactive trickster .
and the two more recently are here today .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
you put it there .
our goal was to simply say , okay .
and over time , they can respond to other people .
for nathaniel &amp; apos ; s sake , music means emotional health .
how are you going to feed the world ? &amp; quot ;
the shrimp are eating phytoplan<unk> .
they moved to a natural concept .
so we have this awful simplified idea .
so two pairs , each one of them is a baby .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there seems to be an inconsistency .
now , the remembered self is a storyteller .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
because they have special skills of processor activity .
i think the curiosity is first .
i wasn &amp; apos ; t familiar with the labels .
it &amp; apos ; s all important possibilities . &amp; quot ;
there &amp; apos ; s another aspect of history .
this is somebody who &amp; apos ; s completely intuitive .
and that &amp; apos ; s a million ##AT##-##AT## dollar company .

so you don &amp; apos ; t lose a lot of foreigners .
the grandfather of this old man refused .

there &amp; apos ; s never been a time like this .
and you know what ? you &amp; apos ; re wrong .
we don &amp; apos ; t want firms to own seeds .
there &amp; apos ; s a couple of really interesting developments .
so there &amp; apos ; s a nice little game dynamic .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t slow down for any of our big problems .
that &amp; apos ; s the kind of educational shame .
it supports other people &amp; apos ; s mistakes .
we &amp; apos ; ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
it just didn &amp; apos ; t happen , you know ?
i want to quickly explain that a little bit .
in two hours , it &amp; apos ; s built all over the place .
in this three sentences , three sentences come in .
i was , in fact , obsessed with the deep sea .
it &amp; apos ; s got a button . it &amp; apos ; s got a button .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
it &amp; apos ; s going to be a challenge for nine .
it &amp; apos ; s great that this number goes up .
i put the last three of the five .
and i &amp; apos ; m saying that &amp; apos ; s good .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of great books on this topic .
and i &amp; apos ; ll just summarize that for you for a second .
i said , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m going to listen . &amp; quot ;
and on and on , you see it all the time .
... just please show the slide .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
it &amp; apos ; s right , moral , patent stuff .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
you hope we don &amp; apos ; t need it .
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
what does that look like ? pretty good .
i don &amp; apos ; t get that feedback in real life .
but it &amp; apos ; s definitely not an optical situation .
but it &amp; apos ; s not just words .
we don &amp; apos ; t know exactly why it happens .
but i &amp; apos ; m going to focus on the demo .
well , who &amp; apos ; s ready for this journey .
today i &amp; apos ; m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i said , &amp; quot ; promised , grandma . &amp; quot ;
i said , &amp; quot ; okay , grandma . &amp; quot ;
but i didn &amp; apos ; t get myself upset .
he came up to me and hugged me .
it &amp; apos ; s connected to oxygen and silicon .
that &amp; apos ; s how you can &amp; apos ; t put them backwards .
now let &amp; apos ; s get something else out of it .
but that &amp; apos ; s what i &amp; apos ; ll talk about in a minute .
at the beginning , the tribal society with language .
three sentence , you know , from school .
i have to say , i don &amp; apos ; t understand .
thank you . i have a question for you .
gamers are gamers in the spiders of social nets .
that &amp; apos ; s just the work that &amp; apos ; s done , by the way .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they get a model that &amp; apos ; s emerging from all the earth .
well , the living self lives continuously .
if it didn &amp; apos ; t move anymore , you &amp; apos ; ve buried it .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
and if it doesn &amp; apos ; t , then stuxnet doesn &amp; apos ; t .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
are you mindful and monstrous ?
i &amp; apos ; m always going to start with an idea , an idea .
and sure enough , we can find fast food chains .
we have to rely on the machine engine .
so , if you could make the light again .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
my grandfather was during the prison prison .
i think that &amp; apos ; s true of every human being on the planet .
the cost of solar energy last year was down by 50 percent .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
blaise , that &amp; apos ; s really incredible . congratulations .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
this hit me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
you may have heard that we &amp; apos ; ve put watermarks on it .
so , don &amp; apos ; t worry about the climate change .
that &amp; apos ; s exactly what i just described .
a baby needs about six scales .
in fact , the notes are very vague and inaccurate .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
that &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s lost half of its value in the first year .
and that &amp; apos ; s the little bit of the message .
&amp; quot ; the best in the industry . &amp; quot ;
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
so i &amp; apos ; m going to step back and take a further perspective .
the first is that we &amp; apos ; re not going to move forward .
we have a abstract abstract language .
go ahead and welcome fear . welcome the risk .
and his answer was &amp; quot ; yes . &amp; quot ;
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
she had not suffered a mental illness .
so , pull them off , and start making them up .
and , of course , how design takes influence in perspective .
so please hear it when a music is played .
but for the lower two billion , it &amp; apos ; s a disaster .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
so you could feel like you could sell it .
they did it by getting out of the country .
it changed my way of making films , completely .
we run into the arms of placebo industry .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .

politics doesn &amp; apos ; t change ; government is changing .
i was a pathetic student .

we repaired them , repaired them .

frostbite , the carbon man gets cleaner every day .
then you &amp; apos ; ll notice that there has been a change .

and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
and these were , in a sense , the first of humans to develop play games .

hey , pandora , are you really serious ?
i &amp; apos ; m never going to play as much as i do at that moment .
and then that was the first early beginning of a musical expression .
and at all , you work much less than i do .

i understood that this is the nature of art .
&amp; quot ; sustainable proteins , &amp; quot ; he said .
with pivots , you can dive into a decade .
it &amp; apos ; s the renewables that are often called renewables .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
i take this hand away . and here &amp; apos ; s the knife .
well , your life self is not going to get happier .
and that &amp; apos ; s a little hard to justify , i think .
it was an extreme situation . it took an extreme solution .
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience .
so i say , let &amp; apos ; s start the world ##AT##-##AT## changing games .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty in biology .
bonobos are along with chimps our closest living relatives .
and in the world , everything made sense to me .
there are a few places we can turn to .
you know , we &amp; apos ; re hearing a lot about transparency right now .
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some possible solutions .
it &amp; apos ; s really just about combining different realities .
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
this is the call center for service and information .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembered self .
someone &amp; apos ; s been broken and had a system that &amp; apos ; s been hacked .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &amp; quot ;
i mean , how much do we honor our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
if you &amp; apos ; ve got something , give it a go .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
they can move inside and do different kinds of experiences .
so they &amp; apos ; re moving around and making art installations like this .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
the pilot took the machine out of the hudson river .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
here &amp; apos ; s a clip from this attack .
of course , this can &amp; apos ; t be done by a human machine leader .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
i went home through the emergency room in my home .
he took a famous photograph . what did it mean ?
the only problem with this was she had 10 children .
so in other words , i define what i want .
if one neighbor helps the other , we strengthen our communities .
i &amp; apos ; m here to share my photography with you .
well , it turns out they &amp; apos ; re right .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
because the images made it more real for them .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
it &amp; apos ; s the really cool part , it &amp; apos ; s called collections .
so what i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you is what &amp; apos ; s really awesome .
i have it on my laptop here . &amp; quot ;
you know , it was a trick , right ?
but at the same time , we know that &amp; apos ; s not possible .
we want to eliminate mass extinctions . &amp; quot ;
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and i collected more and more knowledge all the time .
i studied a printer , and she was in respiratory distress .
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
our steps to digitization of life have been exponential .

that &amp; apos ; s the time you fall in love with .
in fact , if we don &amp; apos ; t pick up phosphorus and make it happen .
he &amp; apos ; s got a forager of 15 to one .
but for many people , it &amp; apos ; s a little bit too radical .
i &amp; apos ; m not part of this group ; i have to say .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &amp; apos ; t work .
they need it , and we don &amp; apos ; t give it to them .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
this is moore &amp; apos ; s law over the last hundred years .
normal people aren &amp; apos ; t accessible to these devices . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s nateness , and it &amp; apos ; s just n<unk> .
and then we give one of these great dunes .
what &amp; apos ; s the next thing you want to talk about .
and i think there &amp; apos ; s almost a contradiction with it .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
because that &amp; apos ; s where government action is happening .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
so we don &amp; apos ; t have a budget like other brands .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
i don &amp; apos ; t know who you &amp; apos ; re familiar with .
isn &amp; apos ; t half a quarter or a quarter ? &amp; quot ;
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
13m is the highest thing i &amp; apos ; ve seen .
i thought we &amp; apos ; re going to bring the poker approach .
that &amp; apos ; s an idiot debate . she has to stop .
but now you can &amp; apos ; t count my fingers , right ?
obviously , it &amp; apos ; s not going to fit all of that into my tiny suitcase .
i &amp; apos ; m going to do it for you and then explain it to him .
you have to admit that &amp; apos ; s a big choice .
i can &amp; apos ; t play the same way in 20 years today .
you do something that &amp; apos ; s actually a little different .
and it &amp; apos ; s a economist . so it &amp; apos ; s logical .
it &amp; apos ; s not perfect , but it &amp; apos ; s much better .
even if you kill someone , it &amp; apos ; s not just a murderer .
and if possible , i &amp; apos ; ll find some of the weird people .
i &amp; apos ; m also going to dissolve what &amp; apos ; s in there .
in the same way , i think we &amp; apos ; re going to play games today .
he said , &amp; quot ; in germany , there is no death penalty .
wr wants to help people who were innocent .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
so when cloning says , there &amp; apos ; s no soul .
i &amp; apos ; ll give you an example of what i mean .
that &amp; apos ; s not just resource efficiency , it &amp; apos ; s efficiency .
that &amp; apos ; s star night , probably never seen it before .
and i said , &amp; quot ; yeah , i really like it . &amp; quot ;
do that once and then experience the sentence .
now that shouldn &amp; apos ; t be a joke , but it &amp; apos ; s a joke .
you don &amp; apos ; t have to spend a lot of money looking great .
the main problem here is something like aids .
we &amp; apos ; re way away from that goal right now .
also , urban ##AT##-##AT## designer and farmer are very interested .
and yet we don &amp; apos ; t really understand the possibilities of this yet .
maybe i didn &amp; apos ; t want to be the aid doctor .
you know , he was here in 1835 .
we &amp; apos ; re all born . we bring children to the world .
that &amp; apos ; s about 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
that &amp; apos ; s the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
probably one of those numbers needs to come very close to zero .
there &amp; apos ; s more to it , there &amp; apos ; s more to it .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t work that way for the remembered self .
that &amp; apos ; s the problem that i &amp; apos ; m trying to solve .
and it was the same after the three months .
we see this in all sorts of human life .
since that time , we &amp; apos ; ve been given all sorts of recognition .
i didn &amp; apos ; t have to talk to the staff anymore .
what other metrics did they go through ?
they don &amp; apos ; t even come from the museums , i think .
we just silly around there as much as we did .
are they so far ? they look a little nervous .
she barely floated , and she was blue .
all right , really good , maybe a <unk> -star .
we &amp; apos ; ve just crossed the 7 ##AT##-##AT## billion ##AT##-##AT## dollar brand .
it was always so inspiring , so slim .
so these women met each other , and they just sat down .
i remember it was yesterday .
but you can combine them with something special like this .
i made a decision to go to the united states .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
i want to tell you about some of the pieces of the puzzle .
this airport alone has a square kilometer of 100 square kilometers .
we found that it &amp; apos ; s moving really strange .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
they wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with the project .
how much money is required to realize that ?
i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
i learned , in a moment , everything is different .
the dog ! i was a linguist .
evolution does not necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
this is another view of the tree of life .
there are other pleasures , but that &amp; apos ; s dominance .
it &amp; apos ; s not about how happy a person lives .
the living self doesn &amp; apos ; t have a voice in that election .
and fortunately , there &amp; apos ; s a whole lot of studies that we &amp; apos ; ve done now .
we don &amp; apos ; t want to try to predict the future before .
as a result , we &amp; apos ; re building stronger social relationships .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
probably a lot of you in the room know this trick .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
it &amp; apos ; s really important that we get there .
so , climate change is going to be terrible for you .
we &amp; apos ; re talking about the flow of information .
it &amp; apos ; s too much of a fish , but it &amp; apos ; s also a bird reserve .
&amp; quot ; yes , &amp; quot ; he said .
&amp; quot ; of course , &amp; quot ; i said .
we &amp; apos ; ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
natural light then gives rise to smart grids .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence at all .

because the notes are the only connection to him .
he &amp; apos ; s only lived for nine years .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
how many doors do you live in ?
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
the answer is no .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
yeah , so what should biohacking be ?
well , chimpanzees are known to their aggressive instincts .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of happy coag .
so here are some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services that we use .
and i persuaded them to finance an expedition .
that &amp; apos ; s the idea of how the soul works .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
that means walking back the crime rates .
so , how does a human being do with certain things ?
and that &amp; apos ; s what we &amp; apos ; d like to look at now .
this is what happened in gene machine age .
the only thing they had was their head .
so we &amp; apos ; re going to start with a windowpan ##AT##-##AT## down droplets .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
go and squawks leonard cohen .
well , i went to the court .
and yet , there &amp; apos ; s this mental disconnect .

now imagine just two other small changes .
what would it be like to live longer with good health ?
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
we went back to the wreckage of titanic .
digaltar is a certified certified mess .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .

the ones that make scientific arguments are very little .
the u.s. drives for hundreds of years .
in fact , progress is on energy progress .
but maybe you can also change it .
to keep the onion , right with the composer .
so it &amp; apos ; s more like the norm .
as it used to happen in the village , as it used to be .
there &amp; apos ; s a political debate in our country .
or other models , or even technical implications .
every big picture is the beginning of a snippet .
you see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
they put it on the beatles machine .
it was the misguided trial against drugs .
a typical walmart is offering you 100,000 products today .
they had 348 different kinds of marinade .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you can actually go inside .
you can see around in all these museums here .
or are you more a down toll ?
i &amp; apos ; ve worked in a coal mining process -- dangerous .
think about it . this attack is applicable .
in fact , it &amp; apos ; s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
or they didn &amp; apos ; t have fofoigraphy .
a little bit more about you than you are .
that &amp; apos ; s the consequence that we have to confront .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
we don &amp; apos ; t want iran to build the bomb .
it was when italy won the football world cup .
they teach you to open your door .
and then i &amp; apos ; ll explain why i explain it .

think about it . it &amp; apos ; s an incredible fact .
and yeah , i &amp; apos ; ll go a little bit further .
designing a phrase with its own breath .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
and how did that succeed for you ? what did it succeed ?
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language speakers .
here are a couple of other people who test it .
but it &amp; apos ; s the sound of clean coal technology .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
and everybody knew it worked like this , right ?
i may have another 40 years of working in me .
we &amp; apos ; re now focusing on the fourth generation .
but don &amp; apos ; t always leave you with a bad thing .
and we &amp; apos ; re often reinventing ourselves as we want .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and it &amp; apos ; s also deeply rooted in our lives .
there &amp; apos ; s a program that some of you may know .
edward gatia is a economist .
you wouldn &amp; apos ; t starve , and you know what ?
let &amp; apos ; s think about how to measure our success .
i mean , you &amp; apos ; ve never seen anything like that .
he &amp; apos ; s a biologist at vesa la palma .
and the question is , why don &amp; apos ; t you have any more ?
then i say , heart suffering , right ?
we can , of course , look at the waste problem .

the next step was to find the apps for this .
we know another one where all the gas stations are .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
when i say reality , i mean photo ##AT##-##AT## real reality .

and all of this leads to a big question .
i can &amp; apos ; t , but this guy can .
i had a relationship with this beauty over a couple of months .
it &amp; apos ; s not just a nice soundscape .
so how do we work when we look in there ?
it &amp; apos ; s virtual reality , and it &amp; apos ; s virtually no computer .
yeah , what kind of projects do we do now ?
like algae -- and other frightening things .
and the world we lived in looked like this .
i was shocked , and i dived into the inner .

the coolest part is -- and this includes the whole circle -- that there &amp; apos ; s this april where freua is going to be an exhibition in downtown los angeles called &amp; quot ; the kinds of stresses . &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that i hope are in harmony with other things that you &amp; apos ; ve heard about , and i &amp; apos ; m going to try to make some connections even if you haven &amp; apos ; t noticed them .
after the success of titanic , i said , &amp; quot ; okay , i want to put my job as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &amp; apos ; m going to be a full ##AT##-##AT## time researcher for a while . &amp; quot ;
here &amp; apos ; s the problem : if i can &amp; apos ; t finish up with my mistakes and talk about it , if i can talk about the quiet voice that tells me what &amp; apos ; s really happening to my colleagues ?
i think there &amp; apos ; s a certain meaning in which we could narrow it down , but in large and large , that &amp; apos ; s something we &amp; apos ; ll have to give up , and we &amp; apos ; ll have to take that complicated perspective on what well ##AT##-##AT## being is .
but the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancer wakes up and realizes that it &amp; apos ; s 11 o &amp; apos ; clock on a tuesday -- and it no longer carries a fifth of god .
last month , this was published with a study that shows up until the end of this decade , in the u.s. &amp; apos ; s sunny areas , six cents per pound , compared to 15 cents per capita cost .
we shouldn &amp; apos ; t tolerate these challenging times or denial , we shouldn &amp; apos ; t try to avoid them , or should we go under the carpet , but it &amp; apos ; s about recognizing the odds of knowing the odds .
the game industry is building console , saving energy and working on mobile phones , rather than the broadband internet , so players around the world can play , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
maybe they saved their people by playing games by getting caught up in games for 18 years , and then they had this kind of forgiveness , and they learned so much about playing with each other that they saved the entire civilization .
i put a check in my pocket on the top of the ted organization , the sapl foundation -- a check at the altitude of 7100 dollars to fund my tedtalk next year .
and when these tools become more body and develop a conscious mind for their movements , each one sees each other and the intric<unk> of our gangs with them , we can begin to begin to do new and more entertaining ways of exploring .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice cap , which has declined for nearly three million years the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
i &amp; apos ; m thankful to the preachoma that he &amp; apos ; s gotten the word again , because after the maurich , you don &amp; apos ; t have to use the word anymore , because everything was bad .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the curious thing about these big houses , where , because of the mixed marriages , six or seven languages , it &amp; apos ; s that you never hear anybody learning a language .
and that may surprise you , because my full ##AT##-##AT## time job at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things we invent and deliver to the poorest two billion lives a better life .
and so you can see how slowly this mechanism unsolves , and what the trace that it leaves out there , which leads to something other than that great image of ourselves , i want to bring you a different story .
and it &amp; apos ; s through this kind of transmission , much like the metaphor of the demeter , but now it &amp; apos ; s not a metaphor of a physical object , it &amp; apos ; s a metaphor of an act , a handshake .

in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just about to measure briefly ; the animal kingdom , like a single stroke , and the human life , a small nomination .
and as i listened to her chest with the stethoscope , i could hear a crummy noise on both sides that told me that she suffered heart failure .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &amp; apos ; s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece of paper , the more mistakes that happens .

this is called the ball in the field , and it &amp; apos ; s coming up , and it &amp; apos ; s not going to be caught , and who tried to throw the ball at the first time , didn &amp; apos ; t make it in time , and the tail was safe .
it &amp; apos ; s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and for all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
i didn &amp; apos ; t pick up the headphones and do what i should have had a phone call when i was a senior doctor , so that he had a chance to have his own picture .
they left lynch and they went to search for a new home , and they left as many people as there was food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of the area where they could thrive .
we &amp; apos ; re talking a lot about very young people here who have spinal cord injuries , who are in the flowers of their lives -- 2020s , &amp; apos ; 40s , &amp; apos ; 40s -- hit by fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
and once again , if you have such a way of feeling that three ##AT##-##AT## sentence in other people , do it , because you &amp; apos ; re going to be happy if you don &amp; apos ; t remember your own lie .
in fact , i had so much of a sense of self ##AT##-##AT## confidence that i asked the nurse what was taking care of a woman , &amp; quot ; do you think it &amp; apos ; s okay when she goes home ? &amp; quot ;
maybe the tremendous progress that we &amp; apos ; ve done in the last century is accelerating by a series of forces , so much that it will allow us to create a world of flooding in the next three decades .

the right circle looks larger than the small one , even though that &amp; apos ; s not the case , but it &amp; apos ; s just the same size , and yet our perception changes as we put things in .
and when i say computer games , they &amp; apos ; re very likely to have eyes that any people in front of them are happy with anything , or that they &amp; apos ; re playing with any console in their hands .
and what we &amp; apos ; ve done since we &amp; apos ; ve done two and a half thousand is we &amp; apos ; ve done the hall , and then we &amp; apos ; ve done two and a half , basically , everything that &amp; apos ; s between the individual system of electronics in software , and we &amp; apos ; ve done software .
you can see here in the upper left , bio<unk> us , that &amp; apos ; s a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a non ##AT##-##AT## profit , where everybody can come .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &amp; apos ; s now being collected from all the data -- from all the collective memory of what looks like , visually , the earth -- and everything &amp; apos ; s connected .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or trying to optimize these processes to make oscillings or new drugs , we can change them with just a small team of molecular biology over the last 20 years .
ok , so when we &amp; apos ; re talking about how much time we &amp; apos ; re currently spending with play , it just makes sense when you &amp; apos ; re holding time on the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
kabone of them -- gggini , egoaca , <unk> h , <unk> i , because i don &amp; apos ; t even know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it &amp; apos ; s fraud .

dg : when you come to this situation , it &amp; apos ; s like you &amp; apos ; ve had too much food , and it &amp; apos ; s about a heart attack . what do you do ? you need a herzoid , or something like that .
but it &amp; apos ; s also a code , and you can also program it , and so you can hack it , like that , and that &amp; apos ; s what i found incredibly fascinating , and that &amp; apos ; s where i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
because i can reach the things like the bits , and they come up to me much more natural than if you &amp; apos ; re talking about hierarchical websites or other mechanisms of making these things available .
and that &amp; apos ; s what we &amp; apos ; re doing , and that &amp; apos ; s how we get , even the talk from premonttena , that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , here &amp; apos ; s a little bit of a little bit .
and as a result , we &amp; apos ; re dealing with the battle with the really difficult question of when someone &amp; apos ; s dead , and that leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &amp; apos ; t have as simple categories as we used to .

and that &amp; apos ; s the question to ask each one of you , and every single day you get something that needs to be done . if not now , when ? and if i don &amp; apos ; t , who ?
but with this logic that &amp; apos ; s just using it , that two sentences are mathematically correct , and a third one that looks like he had something to do with it , so we can save our lives .
instead of just being quiet there , vibrating it was , the way it did it was , sort of like this -- like an expansion of the scale and the bigger black ballast .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was exposed to more androids than a woman who &amp; apos ; s been born with homepage and has a androids .

the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , in terms of the windows -- in part , the dropperation -- part of it , he made all kinds of <unk> ates -- dyslexic use .
and shortly after that , on the 19th of january , they agreed to change the constitution for a change in the constitution to have a viable regulatory regime that &amp; apos ; s in particular development .
and so that &amp; apos ; s at the moment that the candles are already in the scene of increasing this availability of technology and also increasing the information and understanding that more people can engage in there .
we all know that the interactive media is based on definition online , which includes the ruling of linearity , and what we know , of course , is that we feel the linearity now as normal .
first of all , for children in the united states , 100080 hours are the exact same amount of processing that they spend in school from the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss high school .
they threw shiny photos down from the air , which we would consider to be a kind of friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest had never seen anything two ##AT##-##AT## dimensional in their lifetime .

if you &amp; apos ; ve got a vacation trip , and the second week is just as good as the first week , the two ##AT##-##AT## week vacation is twice as good as the week vacation .
if in an environment where the adults are active , or at least they &amp; apos ; re actively hearing music , or at least they &amp; apos ; re growing up , it &amp; apos ; s very easy for a musician to ask , what color does your flower have ?
but there &amp; apos ; s also symbolic functions , why is there anybody in such a little bit of stuff that doesn &amp; apos ; t fit in anyway , so horrendous sums of money , even though it &amp; apos ; s not so practical ?
and sometimes a little prototype of that experience is all it takes to get us from a &amp; quot ; uh ##AT##-##AT## oh &amp; quot ; -- to a &amp; quot ; tada moment .
or , in a way , what you usually understand under a laboratory is that these are sort of <unk> er ##AT##-##AT## driven machines , extremely expensive , extremely insanely , just for professionals , trained academics with titles and so on .
now , as a principle of -- i &amp; apos ; m almost finished -- as a principle of the matter that &amp; apos ; s about thinking about this , which gives all this choice to the developed world , is the material wealth .

and if you look at the people who are talking about it , if you say it &amp; apos ; s better , you won &amp; apos ; t be there , you &amp; apos ; re going to be raining and hostile .
of course , the designers are not just dealing with the subject of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive function , but of course , primarily with the subject of the human object .

i applied the x ##AT##-##AT## ray of my kidneys . when that was without evidence , my colleague , at the revision of the patient &amp; apos ; s eye put a harrowing down in the lower right sector , and called the operatants .
i know you &amp; apos ; ll be asking , &amp; quot ; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &amp; quot ; and that &amp; apos ; s exactly the question that i &amp; apos ; ve spent my work at mit in the last few years dedicated to the future .
pivoc , this application -- i don &amp; apos ; t want to call it a browser ; it &amp; apos ; s really not a browser browser , but you can look at websites like this -- and we &amp; apos ; ll bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .

as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my advisor and my colleague jeanki , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers instead of a mouse cursor that moves like a digital fingertip on a flat surface -- what if we could intervene with both hands and physically reach out of the way we could do it ?
when someone was struggling to do all of these sacred things and shares who they are all , my photo of the noodle cathedral , suddenly all of a sudden is wrapped up in this data , and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this room , into these metastases , which are using photographs of other people , and so they &amp; apos ; re using one of the intersecutors of the interpersonal experience with other .

the boys are separated at the age of three and four , four , four years from their families , and in a shattering world of ecstasy , in stone shafts of glaciers for 18 years , by the time they &amp; apos ; re nine years old , by definition , by the time they &amp; apos ; re pregnant , by the way , by the time they &amp; apos ; re pregnant , by their mother &amp; apos ; s lap .
now , we &amp; apos ; re all using , or many of us , gmail or their competitors . but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using <unk> ers like gmail , because they know that they can trust more than local officials , and they &amp; apos ; re encrypted on the internet so that the government can &amp; apos ; t bail around their conversations .
many of you will be familiar with the story because from steoves , a book later on , which was filmed again with robert down junior , as steve lopez and jamie liz , and jamie drummond , who was the most contested in jurer &amp; apos ; s observatory , who studied justin condor , and who was a promising career with his paranoid .
in fact , i &amp; apos ; ve talked to my professor , richard evan shuld , who &amp; apos ; s the guy who did the psychedelic with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30 years , talked about it , and i argued that you couldn &amp; apos ; t interfere with trending tamines as a hallucinator , because at the moment you feel the impact you &amp; apos ; re not anymore because you &amp; apos ; re a hallucinating hallucination .
for example , women who were using voting law , the idea of the founding fathers , which says that anemia are more important than the anatomical difference , and they said , &amp; quot ; we have a uterus and eggs as a difference , not enough that we shouldn &amp; apos ; t have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have this , the right to be in civic citizenship , the right to own property , etc . &amp; quot ;
there &amp; apos ; s not a lot of place in the malaria that &amp; apos ; s grown in the grizzling of a primate or the cold winds of tibet , but they &amp; apos ; ve yet shaped , through time and ritual , a mysterious bus that &amp; apos ; s not grounded in the idea that it &amp; apos ; s too familiar , but it &amp; apos ; s based on a far more subtle intuition that the earth can only exist because it &amp; apos ; s breathed in human consciousness .
a huge success story , but we also have the problem again , of course , of course , of a growing company , and we &amp; apos ; ve got two thousand , a small group , decided we &amp; apos ; re starting to start and go back to the next topic of the future , and that means , i think , it &amp; apos ; s kind of crazy again , and it &amp; apos ; s crazy to say that people will say , &amp; quot ; nonsense . &amp; quot ;
so that the system is designed to create backups that make it easier for people to feel simple mistakes that inevitably make people inevitable , and it also enables them to create loving environments in which anyone who &amp; apos ; s watching health care can actually address things that are worthy of potential mistakes and even rewarding them . and that &amp; apos ; s what people like me , and that &amp; apos ; s what the mistakes are to be rewarded for and to be rewarded for .
now , if you &amp; apos ; re one of them that doesn &amp; apos ; t accept the evidence of biological evolution , that would be a very good time to switch off your listening device , take your personal communication device -- i &amp; apos ; ll give you permission -- and maybe you can look at kathryn schultz &amp; apos ; s book , which is wrong , because nothing else will make sense of that talk to you .
it &amp; apos ; s fridays &amp; apos ; friday days , fridays &amp; apos ; s friday afternoon . god &amp; apos ; s dog ##AT##-##AT## meal . everybody &amp; apos ; s joking &amp; apos ; s monumbiking &amp; apos ; s &amp; quot ; forever . &amp; quot ; fridays , fridays . fridays , fridays &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; &amp; apos ; s friday . you wouldn &amp; apos ; t have thought we &amp; apos ; d run this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
i &amp; apos ; d like to show you one of the original data sets of noah , and that &amp; apos ; s from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the pointer behind this technology , the photosyntax technology . and that &amp; apos ; s not so obvious , if you look at the environments that we &amp; apos ; ve looked at on the website .
a few years ago , the 2008 price of sheiya yamaniaca was given to his research in which he took a grown ##AT##-##AT## up , a fist , and by manipulation of just four genes that turned it back to an induced cell -- a potential cell to be able to be in your body .
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and that &amp; apos ; s because the person thinks what &amp; apos ; s happening to them is a pharmaceutical company or a sort of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient only believes enough about it , there &amp; apos ; s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
now let &amp; apos ; s take a step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi ##AT##-##AT## billion ##AT##-##AT## dollar organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that have evolved in the last 130,000 years .
it means that a small child from the andes growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apul mind that will be , or your fate , will be a very different human being , and have a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a small child from montana , who thinks that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be thrown away .
usually my role in explaining how wonderful the technologies that are coming up are going to be , and i thought , you know , i &amp; apos ; m here with friends , i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you what i really think . and i &amp; apos ; m trying to go back and understand what &amp; apos ; s really going on here , with these incredible jumps forward , which are so fast that we can &amp; apos ; t keep happening .
so i went home and i ate it with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &amp; quot ; well , wait a second time , if there &amp; apos ; s this technology that you can use with your eyes to control things , we should find a way that temple can control a laser so that he can do graffiti again . &amp; quot ;
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems to invest in something that you have later on -- and that &amp; apos ; s because investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at ipcc , and say , okay , that &amp; apos ; s not a big drama .
and right now in biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.t. code is an abstract code , which is , yes , it &amp; apos ; s not quite the same as computers , because it &amp; apos ; s dynamic because it &amp; apos ; s matter , so it &amp; apos ; s matter , and it &amp; apos ; s not just cyborg .
margaret mead , who said the great anthropologist before she died , said that it &amp; apos ; s her greatest fear that , as we move toward a thread , <unk> less , <unk> less , we would not only see the entire range of human imagination in a way , but that one day we would wake up from a dream , and we &amp; apos ; d forgotten that there &amp; apos ; s ever been other possibilities .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the old southeast , we &amp; apos ; re setting people up -- here &amp; apos ; s the risk of being convicted to death , 11 times higher when the victim is black . 22 times higher when the closeness is black and the victim knows -- in the same state of the united states , whose body is resting people .
i used to travel with a young colleague of mine , 66,000 miles of cherigman in west china , across southeast tibet , to luga , and i saw the face behind the statistics that you hear , and 600,000 sacred monuments that were turned into school and ash . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution were murdered by the kasca .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the award for francis arnold and willow , two scientists who developed no technology to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster , and to have wish proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called the frarnold &amp; quot ; direct evolution . &amp; quot ;
and they &amp; apos ; ve been doing so with two bakers , and they &amp; apos ; ve said , okay , we &amp; apos ; re doing it easier and cheaper , and then we &amp; apos ; ve just got open source hardware , which is open hardware , electronic hardware , and they &amp; apos ; re now building this device , and they &amp; apos ; re now the ones that are in the market for market management , and they &amp; apos ; re now the cheapest supply of these devices .
in the early &amp; apos ; 80s , i got a really amazing task when my professor at harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and infiling the secret communities that were the foundation of duvalide and clay couton coffee that was used to make zooms .
&amp; quot ; cloud ##AT##-##AT## computing computing , &amp; quot ; something that my friends call &amp; quot ; incapable computing computing computing computing computing computing computing , &amp; quot ; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow them to democratize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , synthetic biology , vaccinations and digital food , nano ##AT##-##AT## technology and artificial intelligence .
down here in the picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so there &amp; apos ; s such an enigma garage , with all kinds of possible lab tissues that has been enlisted by college , a group in paris , and it &amp; apos ; s pretty successful , and it &amp; apos ; s also pretty interesting things to do , because i &amp; apos ; m going to cut another project .
and from a talk this morning with dean kamen , one of the innovators of the do it , i want to share it with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technology , the &amp; quot ; sundry , &amp; quot ; and many of you may have heard about it . it &amp; apos ; s the size of a refrigerator in the home .
and so there are different ones , but the nice thing about this is that a molecule has a million times more energy than one , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can handle the problems , and the radiation is mostly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the potential , the impact on the country and other things , almost in a bordera .
the result is -- we call it &amp; quot ; patient autonomy , &amp; quot ; which sounds like a good thing , but reality is a shift in responsibility for making decisions about somebody &amp; apos ; s decisions -- nament by someone who knows nothing , and probably the most likely one is probably not sick , and therefore not the best one in the constitution is a decision -- nament .
and that would be their answer to the bjorn loddenon argument that if you use all this time and all this energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from poverty , the reduction of malaria , and so on , there &amp; apos ; s a stupid waste of resources to invest while there &amp; apos ; s better things we can do .
really , some happy people and companies , forgery and profits , were given a unique opportunity -- because i &amp; apos ; m sure chris anderson will never let that back -- buy the right rights to the talk you &amp; apos ; re seeing at the moment that didn &amp; apos ; t have a name or a lot of information , and there was a lot of clues to what the topic would be .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time it gets rid of the co2 , the skeptics say , &amp; quot ; okay , i &amp; apos ; m not interested in it that it doesn &amp; apos ; t mean co2 , i almost wish it did , but i &amp; apos ; m going to accept it because it &amp; apos ; s cheaper than the previous method . &amp; quot ;
and of course , this was just a simple trick by dr. pppling , so that i didn &amp; apos ; t want to do the kind of exercise i didn &amp; apos ; t want to do , with the chance that five year ##AT##-##AT## olds in the clinic were going to become the second floor in the second stick , but he actually got me to see my daily horrendage with new eyes , and that &amp; apos ; s how it became a new experience .
and to show the dimension , i &amp; apos ; ve taken all sorts of batteries that are being made , looking at cars , cell phones , cell phones , pocket lights , everything . and i &amp; apos ; ve done that with the amount of electronic power that the world uses , compared to what i found is that all the batteries that we &amp; apos ; re producing now could store less than 10 minutes of energy .
if one said no , the veoscope principle was that it made a complete mess , and i &amp; apos ; ve been very harrowing for 10 years , i &amp; apos ; ve been very hard to see if i &amp; apos ; m really going to do an engineering school , maybe i &amp; apos ; m really haunted by my father &amp; apos ; s stuffed to him , because all my colleagues have always talked to him , you &amp; apos ; ve thrown out the window to your kid .
we clean the chromosome out of a microspecies -- roughly , it &amp; apos ; s the same as humans and mice -- and we gave some extra genes so that we could choose this chromosome -- we crushed it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell -- and they &amp; apos ; re going to appreciate our very graphs here .
parks came back again and again to montgolia , where they had two of their oldest friends tracker , and these older women , john carnow , who had never organized the mongoslagley bus -- an incredible american african ##AT##-##AT## american woman -- and durr , who had a white husband , the clifford , the cliffr , dr. king .
bg : so we haven &amp; apos ; t set ourselves to a place , and there &amp; apos ; s a lot of interesting openings for everything called the &amp; quot ; <unk> ar . &amp; quot ; there &amp; apos ; s a lot of interest , and there &amp; apos ; s people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i was talking about the energy minister , and i was talking about how this fits to the agenda .
the human ability to adapt -- that &amp; apos ; s an interesting story , because people ask me over and over again to tell me how to do things , and i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you something about it : that sentence never fit for me , and i &amp; apos ; ve felt very uncomfortable to answer people &amp; apos ; s questions , and i think that &amp; apos ; s why i get started to understand why .
i had recently met this encounter when i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who was now over 90 , but who was her whole life poet , and told me that when she was growing up in the fields of virginia , she was working outside the fields . she said she &amp; apos ; d feel like she &amp; apos ; d hear a poem about the landscape .
now i &amp; apos ; d like to start with an example of someone who had a questionnaire meeting after one of my lectures saying a story . &amp; # 91 ; unclear &amp; # 93 ; -- he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the recording there was a terrible chalk .
and if i now take transmission , for example , in an example , as an overview of what i consider to be , selected as a choice , then in the case , it &amp; apos ; s big to me , i can look at it in the details , and , yes , it &amp; apos ; s called , i can throw it somewhere , or buy it , buy it , buy it somewhere .
these people have come online , but they &amp; apos ; ve acquired it illegal , like trojans , for example , to make money out of our bank accounts while we &amp; apos ; re doing our online banking , or keyboards that have collected our credit card information on the keyboard while we &amp; apos ; re buying an infected computer online .
bruce brown , a well ##AT##-##AT## known design researcher at the briton university , has gone so far to say that this mass media , he says the book and the picture , not the internet , etc . , the internet and so on , what we now call mass media , today , that this mass media outlines our memories of memories and made our ability to virtual reality .
this idea saved me in the middle of the writing process , pray , love . i fell into one of these buried <unk> ors that we all fall into when we &amp; apos ; re working on something and didn &amp; apos ; t work . you realize it &amp; apos ; s going to be a disaster . it &amp; apos ; s the worst book ever written .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of the cathedral , which was just in the computer with images of flickr , and just give nore lady in flickr , and they &amp; apos ; re going to get pictures of men in t ##AT##-##AT## shirts and on the college of the college , and so on . each one of these orange blob represents an image that was considered to be heard as a model .
that made me think of another human being as my friends under the kwakim , who believe that these forests are the equivalent of coukuk &amp; apos ; s place , and the final celestial celestial objects that live in the northern world , the spirits that they would join in their hambursa .
i recommend all of you reading steoves or looking at the film so that you can understand not just the wonderful interconnectedness that happened between these two men , but also how the music was able to make this connection , and how eventually it was the instrument , if that word was allowed , that helped to get hannah &amp; apos ; s from the street .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and who are dealing with nasa , and they &amp; apos ; re in nasa &amp; apos ; s nasa &amp; apos ; s nasa &amp; apos ; s nasa &amp; apos ; s nasa , and they &amp; apos ; re planning the right space station , and they &amp; apos ; re going to go to russia , and they &amp; apos ; re going to go through the mission record , and they &amp; apos ; re going to fly all the way around , and they &amp; apos ; re going to the international space station .
and that &amp; apos ; s really , really , really cool , and you &amp; apos ; ll go into the space phase , just a little bit into it , where i &amp; apos ; d wondered , after 10 years , a thousand mark mark , who was back then , primarily in the collective , of course , if that &amp; apos ; s really great .
we also put one of these things in the same size that it &amp; apos ; s standing there , in the lobby , in the lobby , in fact , the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the lobby , it &amp; apos ; s like this , up there &amp; apos ; s the big battery , here &amp; apos ; s the whole thing that we &amp; apos ; re doing with the net .
you all know the healthy shame when you give a secret to your best friend &amp; apos ; s prize , even though this one &amp; apos ; s assassination on you , and then you get caught up and you get a terrible friend with it , and my terrible discussion comes when you end up with a bad discussion , and you make sure you never make such a mistake again .
so we &amp; apos ; ve done a study in a study that i &amp; apos ; ve done with sh<unk> o benartu and alessandro vio viero , we &amp; apos ; ve done a study with the people who &amp; apos ; ve been working for -- employees that all of them were in a meeting where they signed up for their retirement plan .
you know , one of the great socks on travel , and one of the joys in the field of ethnic nographic research is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , and they still feel their past in the wind , they &amp; apos ; re touching rocks , they &amp; apos ; re smelling in the bitches of plants .
i was afraid , not because , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his conditions , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin , and that if i started talking about tonnas and artisers and peacos and other exciting forms of dentactionism .
so i tried this in my lab at home , and then i got a little bit out of it , and then i went and bought a semannery handbag on ebay , and i tried a little d.c analysis , and i tried a fatigue , so that &amp; apos ; s how we could do it .
and o o &amp; apos ; clock with this premise , for example , then brian deger tried to assemble a miniature of a miniature in england , and then he took a steam pipe , a heat pot , and , you know , zodiac , and then he grew bacteria .
and then in part , if you look at some of the software that we just saw on it , you &amp; apos ; ll also understand why ninety ##AT##-##AT## nine percent of our software today is not intuitive , or not applied to <unk> b , which is , in many areas , including the phone , although it &amp; apos ; s far more intuitive than classical software .
so , the computer visionary algorithms , they took these pictures together , so they captured the real space in which these images were all made close to the grasshopper in the canadian rockies , and you see elements of stabilized , or panama imaging processing , and all of these things are in relation to each other .
interesting historic footnote : when the motion of southern spain conquered the practice of this practice , which turned out to be over the centuries of <unk> h , allah , allah chal√© to ol√© , ol√© , which you &amp; apos ; re still struggling with and flen√© .
if i was in a room full of colleagues and asked their immediate support and telling them what i just told you , i &amp; apos ; d probably not get to the end of the second story before it really got really uncomfortable , anybody &amp; apos ; s going to feel a joke , you &amp; apos ; d shift the topic and forget the rest .
and that &amp; apos ; s when you keep all your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things we really forget about are government , in the core , in the words of tim o &amp; apos ; elow , &amp; quot ; what we &amp; apos ; re doing together we can &amp; apos ; t do alone . &amp; quot ;
and when these people came and looked at who &amp; apos ; s the best protein storage in the world , it wasn &amp; apos ; t a mit professor , it wasn &amp; apos ; t a calf student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked as a local assistant at a rehab clinic at night , and at night , the world &amp; apos ; s best protein dealings .
now , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that has video in real time , some thousands of sensors that have information from the car , pass that information to the system , and then they process it and then use it to send decisions back to that car and change in real time .
if i want to leave you with one thing today , the total amount of data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information to come up with patterns and see trends that would have otherwise not been visible .
there are 175 dressing practices in my supermarket , if you don &amp; apos ; t fill in the 10 different extra olive oil and 12 ballitia that you might be able to buy around a large number of your own salads , in the unlikely case that the 175 is not the store in the store for you .
no biologist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction , because it &amp; apos ; s just not true . and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenarios around biological biodiversity -- hardly the ones that are known to us as the most optimistic scenarios of the cultural biodiversity .
the first one , when you &amp; apos ; re a kid , is that , as a baby , you care about what kind of outlets you have , right ? and as soon as your parents allowed you to play , more or less in the slightest one , the more you feel like you &amp; apos ; ve got to do .
i had written this piece of &amp; quot ; avatar , &amp; quot ; which was supposed to push the measuring bar in things like visual effects and computer generators in new heights , with realistic human character , expressive characters that had been made with cg , and the main figures should be all cg . and the world should be cg .
you know ? i think to allow a person to think that he thinks he &amp; apos ; s thinking , or she &amp; apos ; s like the vessel , like the pelvis and the essence , and the source of all the divine , creative , unfamiliar , infinite , mysterious mystery is a little too little too much responsibility to get them to a fragility of human psyche .
so by contrast , by contrast , contrast , and helplessness to the edges of the individual images , photographs embody , like deep field , colorful colors and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images , and we make them look like a single photograph , even though a single picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
it &amp; apos ; s a way of dealing with witricity from the idea that success , or happiness , depends on challenge , without being associated with the experience , as though my life could be so successful , because i could fall out of the possible life with a prosthetic arm , or whatever , people with my disability .
while i &amp; apos ; ve been looking for models for this over the last year to do this , i &amp; apos ; ve also been looking for it in the past , and i &amp; apos ; ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more reasonable ideas about how to help us deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
it &amp; apos ; s actually dairy that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who had two levels of reflection in two different surgeons , and decide which one to choose , then the one who decides that memory is less bad , and that &amp; apos ; s the surgeon who &amp; apos ; s selected .
so , in fact , in the 20th century , in 300 years , you will not remember the 20th century or the technological innovations or the technological innovations , but rather than an era where we were aiming against and the massive destruction of biological destruction and cultural diversity on the planet , you will either be either active or passive . so the problem is not change .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it has more than 5,000 genetic letters , so we thought , we &amp; apos ; re going to build it in cassette tape size , which is the size of the virus to understand what the components of a living cell are .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature that was believed to be literally living in the walls of an artist &amp; apos ; s orchid -- sort of like dusby , who would come out on the camp 11 -- who would come out and design the artist , in a way , invisible and design the outcome of the work .
you know , when michelangelo formulated the moses , it means that he took the hammer at the end , and he threw it on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot under him -- and she said , &amp; quot ; perch√© paranoi pardon pardon ? why don &amp; apos ; t you talk ? &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; m probably one of the two nice girls i &amp; apos ; m hearing are probably the generation that was probably the generation of this bad ferrko image because i &amp; apos ; ve begun to study nine hundred and a half of them in karate engineering college , technical engineering college today , i think it &amp; apos ; s called kieater .
and i know some of you say , &amp; quot ; isn &amp; apos ; t it better ? &amp; quot ; if we all talked a better place , if we &amp; apos ; d talk only a language ? &amp; quot ; and i say , &amp; quot ; well , let &amp; apos ; s be this language of yorkba . let &amp; apos ; s be kran .
it would be great if we could take this paradigm of normality against another possibility or power to actually replicate it a little bit more endangered , so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to engage their very special and valuable skills to society .
if i show you 600 papers and i show you 400 categories , or i &amp; apos ; m going to show you 400 magazines , and i &amp; apos ; m going to split them into 20 categories , and you &amp; apos ; ll think i &amp; apos ; ve given you more choice , and i &amp; apos ; ve given you a better way than i &amp; apos ; d given you the 400 .
he spoke in a very hot and social and social sound about yoyo and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never be able to do it in the baseball world . and that &amp; apos ; s all because of the fainless passage of the last sentence in beethoven &amp; apos ; s fourth sentence .
this was the most surreal form of a d√©sum√© i &amp; apos ; ve ever experienced , because before i got to a corner , i &amp; apos ; ve always known what would appear in the light of the vehicle for a month , because i &amp; apos ; d run the movie for months .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban center , like our fellow scott silverman is part of the program -- in fact , they &amp; apos ; re all doing this -- you &amp; apos ; ll see that the government who calls the government because of many different problems , including a rat in your house .
we &amp; apos ; re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think that we &amp; apos ; ve had to go back hundreds of , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time when we &amp; apos ; ve been fighting progress in which we &amp; apos ; ve talked about these things that are crucified , more broadly than we &amp; apos ; ve been facing right now .
what i &amp; apos ; m going to show you first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &amp; apos ; re giving microsoft as part of a year ago , which is seadams . and it &amp; apos ; s an environment where you can either move around locally or with vast amounts of visual information .
this equation has four factors : a little bit of multiply . you have this thing on the left -- co2 that you want to get to zero , and that &amp; apos ; s going to depend on the number of people , from the services that each person is using on average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that &amp; apos ; s going to involve energy per unit of energy .
in my about 20 years of medical records and journalism , i created a personal medical research on medical errors and false treatments so that i could do anything for my first article that i wrote for the toronto star of my show , &amp; quot ; white cock , black style , &amp; quot ; which is to learn .
so we have a situation where , as we continue to continue our science continues , we have to stand around so much more so that these categories that we thought would be a stable anatomic class that would make very simple <unk> ations to create permanent values , much less sharper than we &amp; apos ; ve assumed .
and what we &amp; apos ; ve done is we &amp; apos ; ve actually had a new kind of network that &amp; apos ; s been used all over the world -- that &amp; apos ; s a mobile phone network -- and anonymity , using information from this network that &amp; apos ; s collected from the operator to understand how the city works .
and if you pick a different vacation , there &amp; apos ; s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &amp; apos ; s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you &amp; apos ; d get an answer . and if you think about memories of memories , you might get a different answer .
and then , just from the do ##AT##-##AT## it ##AT##-##AT## yourself biophysito website , the founder of the founder , and said , okay , we need to actually meet , we &amp; apos ; re going to meet ourselves in real time , we &amp; apos ; ve organized two events , one in london , two thousand , and a half in the u.s. , in san francisco .
my colleague at mit , asaf bider , could still tell you a lot more about the senses and the many other wonderful things you can perceive with , but i &amp; apos ; d like to talk to you about the second part that we discussed at the beginning , and that &amp; apos ; s the impact of our environment .
a group from ankara , who i met a while ago , who &amp; apos ; s a group of students who liked to convey more of the public , what they learned in college , and they &amp; apos ; ve done so on a permanent little action , and they &amp; apos ; re trying to explain what nfa is .
i think a significant one -- not the only one , but a significant part of the explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people experience the disappointment because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain themselves , they think it &amp; apos ; s their fault .
the people in the back , or the people who will see this later on video will say , &amp; quot ; well , that &amp; apos ; s pretty impressive , but if it were real , it would be -- you see , here &amp; apos ; s a hole and there , if it was real , it would be bloody . &amp; quot ;
but it &amp; apos ; s going to be that 17 brands that were willing to get rid of this control that wanted to do with someone who wanted to do things so remarkable and replay as i do , and who eventually helped us to tell stories that we didn &amp; apos ; t usually have , stories that would never have -- that would never be helpful .
but because there was only one company willing to help us -- and that &amp; apos ; s just because i know john bond and richard church -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle man , and go straight to my team .
i mean , most eye moments of our lives -- and i &amp; apos ; ve guessed this -- you know , the psychological presence is about three seconds long . what it means is that in a lifetime there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are about 600,000 views . most of them don &amp; apos ; t leave .
but we don &amp; apos ; t even even think of someone like this because we &amp; apos ; ve known this kind of thing for so long , we &amp; apos ; ve had this notion of internal light and collective accepted that creativity and suffering somehow and art -- at the end of the day -- always leads to the souls .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , that if you &amp; apos ; re willing to narrow down , and the important unreasonable possibilities are going to be gone , well , there &amp; apos ; s a increase in sales , there &amp; apos ; s a cost of sales , &amp; quot ; r &amp; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; amp ; d , and there &amp; apos ; s an improvement in decision ##AT##-##AT## making .
i had to repeat the individual exercises for infinite times with these dials , elastic bounds -- in different colors -- you know , they know how to make my leg muscles , and i hated these tapes more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
now , not exactly what i hoped myself , but i went -- the stairs going up , the stairs going down , the real &amp; quot ; real firemen &amp; quot ; at that time , who were already quite ready to get some shoes in the bedroom .
for some time , i &amp; apos ; ve been interested in the placebo effect , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because , you know , you think it &amp; apos ; s like me , &amp; quot ; a deception that becomes a little bit true if somebody just believes enough of it . &amp; quot ;
and where you see how far we &amp; apos ; re from , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we might be , that we &amp; apos ; re at all on earth , you can see that , for example , open bach has a program , 20 to 40 hundred dollars here , right ?
and they &amp; apos ; re going to be healthier , and they &amp; apos ; re going to be trained better by the <unk> iliad academy , and by having the opportunity to use 3d printers and machine computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
well , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little it is , i have memories of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &amp; apos ; s a real question . why are we spending so much memories of the weight that we &amp; apos ; ve experienced ?
because we feel that self ##AT##-##AT## deception , that sense of being great , descent of the highest creature , is not one of those things that &amp; apos ; s been so unpredictably , of something like an organism that &amp; apos ; s still existing to be a stone and the other things that &amp; apos ; s inundable to us .
look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo acidiosover in a trance that uncompresses fireworks with no combustion , an amazing illustration of the spirit of the mind so that it stops when it &amp; apos ; s put into a state of extreme arousal .
quatrite are things that are playful , fresh like the freestyle prince , predominantly , adventurous , adventurous and sweet and sweet , agile .
and the insight of president lobo was that the certainty of the occupation that i &amp; apos ; ve been thinking about as a way to get foreign investors to come and build this city equal importance for all parties in honduras who suffer fear and mistrust for many years .
i wanted to go back to routine and to comfort the comfort of a life of unknown life -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who were every single day as close as 20 years since they told each other the stories of their day , and we were still sleeping with three in the same bed .
it really works , and it &amp; apos ; s done in academia , and then we thought , okay , we might get that , then we took a webcam , which is going to turn the lens off , reverse the lens , then you &amp; apos ; ve got a microscope that expands by about four hundred times .
in this picture , i &amp; apos ; ve laid out a bush as a center of branching into all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing structures on the tips of these two branches have been success : they survived ; it has survived its mental fitness and strength .
i read this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh , and it was so ridiculous , but i just came to the point where i was just going to go , &amp; quot ; and i couldn &amp; apos ; t stop reading , and i had to stop reading , and once i went to this overshoot , i had to go back and collect myself after that overdose of shock and that connected emotional shock .
this may seem a little bit more remote , so i repeat that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to end up playing next decade .
we don &amp; apos ; t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually transmitted to other men with death is because he &amp; apos ; s willing to take a gender condition , in which case he can stay alive .
so what &amp; apos ; s happening in &amp; quot ; the great forest venery &amp; quot ; is that everything from the top to the bottom , from the bottom , from the very beginning , is completely loaded with brands -- from the front page of the magazine you &amp; apos ; ll see in the movie , that &amp; apos ; s the x brand .
the greatest car you &amp; apos ; ve ever driven out of &amp; quot ; the great forest of the great pond , &amp; quot ; which is the greatest drink you &amp; apos ; ve ever had , a sense of &amp; quot ; the great forest of the great atollarie de solver . &amp; quot ;
and there was a time when there was only jeans in it , and they bought them , and they were bad at it , and they were incredibly impractical , and if they had been wearing them for a long time and lots of times , they started feeling &amp; quot ; ok . &amp; quot ;
and maybe a little bit of perspective on what might happen in a few decades from now , if you have cyborg bodies to do something , or other things , in all kinds of post ##AT##-##AT## humanistic future speakers that i can think of as a science fiction fan .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , g.g.gzhansky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a phrase , &amp; quot ; nothing in biology does not make sense except in the light of evolution . &amp; quot ;
the neollithic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment the cuban missile crisis , the poetry of the shaman , set up the shame of the shaman of the priesthood and created hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- just 10,000 years ago .
and the problem , it &amp; apos ; s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be a problem , it can be just a problem solving , so simplify things , throw any problem , and how you can do that , or how you can do it better .
and then there &amp; apos ; s a remembered self , and it &amp; apos ; s the reminder of the sharing and the history of our lives , and it &amp; apos ; s all that the doctor talks about : &amp; quot ; how did you feel in the last time ? &amp; quot ;
and one day , he watched me do one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tiring and gendlessly -- and he said to me , &amp; quot ; wow , aimee , you &amp; apos ; re so strong , powerful and young girls , you &amp; apos ; re going to tear one of these tapes .
this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called <unk> h , pray , love -- which , unlike all my previous books , came out of the world for some reason , and became a big mega ##AT##-##AT## mega ##AT##-##AT## <unk> event , international act .
but the process and the heavy plumbing that surrounds him was lifted up when he pulled out the genius , where he didn &amp; apos ; t solve anything as a anger , and then left him where he came from . he realized it had to be an internal , tormented thing .
in our desire to protect the people who are at heart and tell us the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even to put a forecast on the quality of life that they &amp; apos ; re supposed to be expected , we need to pay attention to the fact that somebody is actually disabled .
in fact , the nice thing about this is , if you do this , agriculture , biogas , biogas , in a heckling country with five thousand people in favelas , so that a farmer can produce about a hundred and a half thousand dollars , and they &amp; apos ; ll wait to grow chickens and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables .
every time we think about born and think landscape , we &amp; apos ; re either called roughts , and we &amp; apos ; re devils of the noble wild , which , in its simplicity , is an argument of racism , or perhaps thorium , and those people are more connected to nature than we are .
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the big scientists that we &amp; apos ; ve done , we need only 10 million . and even if we tried to test our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &amp; apos ; s reasonable , you &amp; apos ; re just in the 100,000 ##AT##-##AT## million .
imagination is more imported to kentuces , and with this phrase , i &amp; apos ; d like to close it as well , a , and again , let &amp; apos ; s think that designers need to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention , and please .
that &amp; apos ; s a little bit of an artistic order , so there &amp; apos ; s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers working with these technologies to come together and ask questions and process them , because there &amp; apos ; s museum exhibitions and there &amp; apos ; s , all kinds of things .
so , the tedtalk was very simple in terms of a charter city , which is a place where the beginning of the uninhabited country is a green ##AT##-##AT## city contract , which defines the laws that exist there , and gives people the opportunity to either choose either under those rules or not .
later on the day , i was driving around this site with miguel , and i asked him , &amp; quot ; for a place that seems to be so natural , &amp; quot ; unlike any farm i &amp; apos ; ve ever had , &amp; quot ; how do you measure success ? &amp; quot ;
and the wind and the sun have simulated it , and they came up with the result , a very exciting thing , that you have to do with the conventional system , which , after 20 years , takes about 50 cents per hour , about four cents an hour , about four cents a half cents .
the reason for this is that if i would draw it on a normal curve , where we would say , these are the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a random piece of technology that i want to show you , the graph is going to be silly .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea that you bring new elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is promoting trust and trust -- while it &amp; apos ; s also making great fun of your fun .
so where the founding fathers were extremely suspicious of how individuals could be protected from the state , it &amp; apos ; s possible that if we put more mothers into this concept , we would keep more of a concept , not just how to protect each other , but how to take care of each other .
a continent is always left out because there was no religious faith in sub ##AT##-##AT## saharan africa . of course , there was a and voodoo just the remains of this very profound religious thought that during the tragic diaspora of time , there was no religious faith .
we &amp; apos ; ve been working with roberto boltzle , who &amp; apos ; s one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the √©sum√© at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scriala in milala -- we &amp; apos ; ve recorded his movements in 3d to use it for the flympe fire .
many companies tend to -- and that &amp; apos ; s the human nature of nature -- avoid things that you &amp; apos ; re not sure you &amp; apos ; re going to be afraid to avoid , these elements , and that you &amp; apos ; re welcome , and you &amp; apos ; re actually turning them into something positive for yourself , and that &amp; apos ; s a game ##AT##-##AT## changer .
with total transparency , which is the new thinking , which goes to the old thinking , don &amp; apos ; t tell you that in the lag of horse meat , there &amp; apos ; s no more beef , or any other phenomena , that &amp; apos ; s what i want to do right now , and that &amp; apos ; s what i want to do at all .
he was driving at high speeds when he suddenly heard a little fragment of a melody that is often very , very difficult for him to find him , and he wants to have them . she &amp; apos ; s a prairie , but he can &amp; apos ; t touch them .
and when i step out and look at everything , i can rearrange my search for the past , here i was looking for &amp; quot ; nebula &amp; quot ; again , here we go , or here , live labs .
here it looks like he &amp; apos ; s looking for a date , but what he &amp; apos ; s really looking for is somebody who &amp; apos ; s screwing him up when he &amp; apos ; s gone , because he knows he &amp; apos ; s not very good at burning a snow when he &amp; apos ; s covered .
these older people now come to me and say , &amp; quot ; mr , son , wait , give talks . they tell people to stop saying that we have to do it for the first time in our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &amp; quot ;
that &amp; apos ; s when you focus a laser on a laser , in a room , so you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so that &amp; apos ; s kind of trapped , like a tractor ray of the <unk> ator , basically .
here &amp; apos ; s another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call from a young man who was born when he was a young man , and he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he just found that he had erected sticks and a mother .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to reach a hand , and i didn &amp; apos ; t do it , all the fences that i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do , and i never did .
but if we look at this metallic map that &amp; apos ; s very simple , compared to ours , trust me , that &amp; apos ; s easy , but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate after the other , it &amp; apos ; s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
there &amp; apos ; s a couple of pilot projects that are creating this at a 60 percent level -- 80 percent level , but getting 100 percent difficult . and one of them is getting a huge challenge for getting co2 emissions , but the biggest problem here is the storage question .
i &amp; apos ; m going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman , ekamenca , ranji , who led us to save the decisions for almost a million americans for retirement from about 650 plans across the united states .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature , for us , doesn &amp; apos ; t move between men and female , or between male and interfemale , and inter<unk> , we are , in fact , the ones that give this separation to us as natural as a result .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be on the aid of partners , they could benefit from their partner partners , who would benefit from the laws for this charter , and in the process of supporting each trust that the charter can actually be enforced .
and then the next one that &amp; apos ; s already worked with &amp; quot ; nd neural model , &amp; quot ; or mental model like software , that &amp; apos ; s what software would have said , is that you would have an idea of something , the metaphor of a desktop metaphor to harness the computer .
they knew that about 75,000 <unk> ilians are leaving their country to go out into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do the same thing in honduras .
now , in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that has recently come to the market is how to manage the best choice , something that david lavion has been very much designed for , it &amp; apos ; s a program that &amp; apos ; s offered harvard .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malaysia coast , and the young man who broke up and died , the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first person to give me on the platform .
we followed the geneticist eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about the pressure , they said that one of the people had become so old , because of his age , and we killed him with the speculation .
and now you might be able to talk about why this is a deception , why you don &amp; apos ; t realize that it &amp; apos ; s just three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information is , it &amp; apos ; s not counting , it &amp; apos ; s one , two , three , but it &amp; apos ; s as a group .
and in front of the background , i &amp; apos ; ve moved to the field of natural jurisdiction interface design , which is the next generation in the human computer in the relationship of the human computer to how our tools , or how computers change from the computer , or how the computer changes from the computer in the digital assistant to the digital assistant .
they then spent over a three ##AT##-##AT## month period of time with a &amp; quot ; good &amp; quot ; note , &amp; quot ; very good , &amp; quot ; and they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they really wrote down .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to nine percent renewable , and then there &amp; apos ; s this rest , the rest , the last 10 , 20 , 20 percent renewable , that &amp; apos ; s going to be very , very expensive , and that &amp; apos ; s not going to work out the batteries .
the main reason for this is that maybe we enjoy it with this huge shelves of mayan , senegal , senegal and marinward , but we can &amp; apos ; t , in fact , draw the compare and the borders , and then we can actually choose something that &amp; apos ; s fantastic .
here you have this censors between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps out , without being able to do anything about it , and the things you know are very different , so that you can make them look a lot better for you and others .
i took them with , and i gave them access to the world at the bottom , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have the sympathy for the difficult situation of the native americans , they look at it as ordine and they &amp; apos ; re very happy , but they sort of narrow down to the past , while the real world , our world , goes on .
by playing music and talking about music , from this paranoid , confusing man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a lovely , educated , well ##AT##-##AT## educated , well ##AT##-##AT## educated musician .
instead , what i do , and what i do , the designers of thinking , is we think at a certain abstract level , we give this machine a little bit of a machine , and the machine makes something that makes our capabilities go up a lot better than we could ever do .
we talked about this subject . and you know what ? for most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the fake modern artist who tried to master this uncontrolled creative impulse in him and with them .
but if you buy a new laser printer today in 2011 from the top laser printer and print a page , it &amp; apos ; s got this bright yellow blob on every page , in a pattern that clearly tracks the page and gives back its printer back .
it &amp; apos ; s just like , what &amp; apos ; s happening is we &amp; apos ; re feeding plants of plant herbs , harmful plasticides , chemicals on the planet , chicken eggs , chicken eggs , and all the time , the agricultural industry just wondered , &amp; quot ; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &amp; quot ;
some of the expeditions i &amp; apos ; ve seen in thermal vents , and sometimes things that i &amp; apos ; ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science of science at the time when we saw them , there were no words .
so it &amp; apos ; s not just a farm that doesn &amp; apos ; t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success to the health of their predators , but a farm that &amp; apos ; s literally a water supply facility , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
in fact , i &amp; apos ; ve been exposed to the vast majority of my career to terrible situations , and that &amp; apos ; s what i &amp; apos ; ve been trying to do in trying to study social rambling so that they &amp; apos ; re engaging and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes them accessible and accessible to the audience .
and then the renaissance and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &amp; apos ; s put the human individual individual in the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery . and there &amp; apos ; s no room for mystic creatures to embrace the freedom of divinity .
they &amp; apos ; re adding the explosive co2 that &amp; apos ; s going to increase in temperature , and that temperature levels have some very negative effects , effects on the weather , and maybe worse , the speculation that natural ecosystems can &amp; apos ; t adapt so fast to change , and so whole systems collapse .
but in fact , you &amp; apos ; d been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate if it worked , but since there &amp; apos ; s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right materialistic approach , it looks like it works .
she didn &amp; apos ; t draw fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &amp; apos ; t reach the house , and she took the poem and she walked through it , and she fit it . she said it would keep moving across land , and -- as she said , chattering , looking for another poet .
how can these people find them from a flora of 80,000 species of adrenalical plants that don &amp; apos ; t find these two morphologically non ##AT##-##AT## related plants , which , if combined in this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
tan le , anonymous in food business , was now tan , refugee and social activist , who was invited to speak at the places she had never heard of , and at home , whose existence she had never imagined .
and dr. kean continued to say , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; ve learned that kids , if they don &amp; apos ; t keep getting anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , then kids can do a lot of support . &amp; quot ;
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political guide -- and then we lean back and we expect that government to reflect our values and our needs , and then hasn &amp; apos ; t it changed much ?
well , what you could do with a patient , and we actually did a clinical trial , and it &amp; apos ; s been made , you know , it &amp; apos ; s been done , and it works , you could actually extend the reflection of a patient by simply letting the hose in there without being too much on it .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , which you don &amp; apos ; t know what the subject will be , and which you &amp; apos ; ll be able to fly after all the content around your ears , especially if i &amp; apos ; m making your company stupid .
about an hour after she arrived at home after i left her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 . the bailouts brought her back to the emergency room with a blood pressure station of 50 , which is a dangerous condition .
understand that it &amp; apos ; s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to jail because they don &amp; apos ; t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss large investment in their employers .
at that point , the patients are coming in . they can &amp; apos ; t just take control , captain on their own ship , but they can also help us with the health of the challenges facing us , and the cost of health care , double the cost of health care , and so on .
the next couple of weeks , i proposed to myself , and i learned for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , not the kind of healthy shame you feel , because you can &amp; apos ; t talk to the colleagues about it .
this curiosity also showed me that if i wasn &amp; apos ; t in school , i would go through the forests of the forests and collect &amp; quot ; samples , &amp; quot ; frogs and snakes and hammergers and monchwater , everything would bring back home and look underneath the microscope .
so i wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &amp; apos ; t understand why people thought that was &amp; quot ; frankenstein &amp; quot ; -- why they thought molecules were happening in a particular way , instead of taking a random shot at the nature of nature .
maybe they &amp; apos ; ll afford a modern ##AT##-##AT## day contribution , and if they &amp; apos ; re going to do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &amp; apos ; t give up because they &amp; apos ; re very shy , because they all have significant problems .
and as you can see , you have our seven senses , most people think we &amp; apos ; ve only got five , and now we &amp; apos ; re already seven , and i &amp; apos ; m sure there &amp; apos ; s another seven coming up in the near future , and you &amp; apos ; re going to add meaning , and you &amp; apos ; re going to add up to it as well as extension of our self .
since then , i &amp; apos ; ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with citos of endless businesses , and there &amp; apos ; s something about this task that &amp; apos ; s really allowed to bring deep footprints into nature , and i want to share some of them with you .
so , if you look at google glass , for example , it &amp; apos ; s such a concept that reconnects us the virtual world with the real world , which is our affection for virtual realization , which is to feel the virtual reality of something normal , it &amp; apos ; s going to be addressed again .
and then , if i go one more step further into these natulic interfaces , where i &amp; apos ; m voice by voice , by hand , by touch , by gesture , by acting as a mouse , and curating things , i &amp; apos ; m even faster and even more immediate .
now , what &amp; apos ; s causing this thing is that it &amp; apos ; s catching the sensors of sensors -- so , for example , print sensors and micro ##AT##-##AT## controllers -- and it &amp; apos ; s providing legislative code that &amp; apos ; s going on even during the attack with the wrong data .
i think i &amp; apos ; m more likely to make sure that we don &amp; apos ; t necessarily have to have to overcome <unk> tions , but that we &amp; apos ; re open to embrace them , to hustle , to take them on the cockroach , to use it as well as to even dance with it .
we believe that po<unk> -- we believe that po<unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and so we &amp; apos ; re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million hides every month .
but what happens , almost always , is that &amp; quot ; ta ##AT##-##AT## da &amp; quot ; becomes &amp; quot ; uh ##AT##-##AT## oh , &amp; quot ; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to fall and fall down .
so , what that means is , if we look back at what &amp; apos ; s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people &amp; apos ; s place in evolution , and particularly what we &amp; apos ; re looking forward to in the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
you &amp; apos ; re doing it for the sake of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there are . you &amp; apos ; re making it out of the discovery because of exploration , and because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people form a team .
i &amp; apos ; ve told you about four techniques that are going to solve the problem of decision ##AT##-##AT## making -- narrow down the alternatives -- concrete , making it real ; categorizing -- we can do better with more categories , less opportunities to prepare for complexity .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &amp; apos ; ve ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how i think about other people .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and the thermophil are there , and by that way , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum of fish to follow , and yet they managed to make it a habitable environment for themselves .
i think they &amp; apos ; re so brave and strong , and so radical , in what they did , i &amp; apos ; ve taken a look at the sheer malthus music table in 1776 , and it &amp; apos ; s not because of the music that &amp; apos ; s absolutely forgotten .
i don &amp; apos ; t know if that &amp; apos ; s smart , if you look at the importance of this problem in front of your eyes , but there &amp; apos ; s now a discord in geoengineering about whether you should be able to have that , if things get faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
i also believe that there are theories that begin to understand how everything started with rna , but i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you a simplistic story about what it is that at that time , little oil droplets were surrounded by chemicals that kept different types of recipes .
because i don &amp; apos ; t care if it &amp; apos ; s the minister of health , who says , &amp; quot ; hmm , i &amp; apos ; m not going to take the evidence of my experts &amp; apos ; mammography , &amp; quot ; or any cancerous tover who wants to treat his patients with coffee houses .
and if you &amp; apos ; ve done this for a couple of minutes , you &amp; apos ; ve done that the patient &amp; apos ; s life is worse than a patient &amp; apos ; s own , and you &amp; apos ; ve made the case that the patient &amp; apos ; s memory is much better off because now the patient has given a better story about his experience .
in addition , because you think he &amp; apos ; s a male -- although i didn &amp; apos ; t tell you he &amp; apos ; s the one with xy -- because you think he &amp; apos ; s a male , he can now be pulled in , which maria doesn &amp; apos ; t have to worry about .
the first project we &amp; apos ; ve done as an international group , when we &amp; apos ; ve become kind of aware of ourselves , ok , ok , we &amp; apos ; re here now as real scene , and we &amp; apos ; re online , and we know the people who chatted and so on .
in other services , like the manufacturing of fertilizer , 105 : 06 : 55,000 -- &amp; amp ; amp ; d : 05 : 55,000 or air transport , or air transport , is the play room for very small improvement .
again , the idea is to imagine , again , what we &amp; apos ; re doing is we &amp; apos ; re going to engage people with something to do and change the environment -- almost like what we call &amp; quot ; cloudburst motion , &amp; quot ; but with a cloud .
so this whole debate , as is moving back and forth , moving energy forward , as it should go , we have , for example , five to 30 percent accuracy , so we &amp; apos ; re tiring the wind and the sun &amp; apos ; s rules .
and then i &amp; apos ; d just hold it up to six and then we &amp; apos ; d become co ##AT##-##AT## founder of the company , and then i &amp; apos ; d become the founder of the company solo , which then became one of the largest cell companies in the world .
it &amp; apos ; s not by the latest jogging and tractors , but by fertile land , not by pumps , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by ketchlings , but by forest forests , not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the ocean .
and in this song , we &amp; apos ; ll be able to rediscover the possibility of what we are : people with conscious awareness , who are aware of the importance of all people and gardens to flourish , that all the people and gardens have to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
and finally , a consequence of buying a bad seat jeans when there &amp; apos ; s only a way to buy it , that if you &amp; apos ; re uncontent , and you wonder why , who &amp; apos ; s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you have done ?
you can think of this cultural web as a race of race . ethnic sphere , as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , can be defined , myths , inspiration and intuitive ways of defining human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
i also want to point out that i &amp; apos ; m not sure we should be distributing rights to people that way , because i have to admit that i know a series of golfing greats that are probably more likely to make social benefits than some of the people i know .
i &amp; apos ; ve always prepared my synonymous dictionary , but i &amp; apos ; ve done the work of the text , and i &amp; apos ; ve noticed that i &amp; apos ; ve never looked into my life , which means the word disabled .
she ran like the devil when she was pursued by this poem , and the only thing she did was she quickly got to a piece of paper and she had to get a pen so she could catch it as she could , you know , grab it through it and grab it on the sheet .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is half a day &amp; apos ; s energy use without co2 , and i &amp; apos ; ll take that wish .
he told me , &amp; quot ; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never be as moving as other kids , or that you could never live an independent life , and since then they just lie me . &amp; quot ;
what kids do is they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successful prototypes , with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have a lot of opportunity to repair <unk> y ##AT##-##AT## sized prototypes .
and yeah , so you can see , it &amp; apos ; s relatively heterogeneous , so there &amp; apos ; s a number of people doing their own home , all the way to large larger organizations that are already doing this in more institutional form .
so maybe the implications of this technological change is that there &amp; apos ; s always been a different truth , which is that every human being in society can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus plus is .
we look in this web , we see the 50 hertz , and if it &amp; apos ; s going to get nine <unk> a nine years old , we &amp; apos ; re going to catch some valves , then we &amp; apos ; re going to go back up again a little bit of merry steam , and then we &amp; apos ; re going to get up .
so we started with a few volunteers who helped us , a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , to tag things that they threw away -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would throw away .
what if you could change the sperm and the ovarian cells , or the newly fertilized egg , to give your children a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating the diabetes of diabetes , eliminating the hemoglobin , reducing the risk of cancer ?
that &amp; apos ; s the problem : transparency -- free of deception and sweat just to explore and look through ; understand immediately ; it &amp; apos ; s understanding of sight and access to information , especially in terms of business as a business model -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
for example , there &amp; apos ; s an anecdote , for example , that the report of a chapters in this area that can &amp; apos ; t be used in this area of large fishing , can &amp; apos ; t be used , or will not be used by fishing scientists , because it &amp; apos ; s not &amp; quot ; scientific . &amp; quot ;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &amp; quot ; i got here to tell this young man , don &amp; apos ; t lose the goal . don &amp; apos ; t give them up . &amp; quot ;
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off , and work in an environment that &amp; apos ; s pretty much anything that they hate , and let &amp; apos ; s have them work in government .
and those sounds and those rhythm have shown the topology of a region , and it also has allowed them to be able to circle these songs into fragments , and then go back to the left , to the right , and move back to the initial place .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture of architecture , as in this case , you know , this day , when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &amp; quot ; you &amp; apos ; ve destroyed the building . &amp; quot ;
i graduated from graduate school , and i hope the video works , which is a very , very nice project , which is the bachelk work of michael burburchk , anklan , joriklos morgan and jansky .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and he began to play a couple of cuts from vilivia concerts , and then asked me to play them at the end : mende , kazerry , chaikovski , sighishius .
so she runs to the house , and she looks for the paper , and the poem goes through it , and she grabs a pen just as it goes through her , and then she said , &amp; quot ; it &amp; apos ; s like taking her hand and getting it to the other hand .
i committed myself to the place , to his brother and his father -- in the words , &amp; quot ; all right , my proposal is this way : tony &amp; apos ; s going to talk , we &amp; apos ; ll get him a machine , and we &amp; apos ; ll find a way to make his art again .
and then when i put another half of that , suddenly we don &amp; apos ; t just see one unit , which is circle , circle , and yet , we see a unity , we don &amp; apos ; t see three pieces , one circle , one circle , another .
and that &amp; apos ; s where they &amp; apos ; re also initiated by my general doctor so that he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment i need cardiology or whatever , but also with a view of the past .
i don &amp; apos ; t have to make these things emotionally emotional , because right around the corner there &amp; apos ; s always another crazy , colorful , colorful , radial radiation , which is only waiting for me to have a little bit of love and look at it .
something interesting happened in &amp; quot ; abyss &amp; quot ; : to solve a narrator problem in this movie -- and that &amp; apos ; s to say , we had to create some kind of liquid water that we built on computer ##AT##-##AT## generated animation , cg , back .
and then there &amp; apos ; s some stuff that &amp; apos ; s really arrived in life , which most people don &amp; apos ; t realize , for example , detergent enzymes that allow us to wash with four degrees of laundry , are also more technically engineered .
and it &amp; apos ; s very amazing , because it &amp; apos ; s actually believed that this high ##AT##-##AT## technology that you &amp; apos ; ll find that it actually brings you into the future , but in fact it &amp; apos ; s the future that &amp; apos ; s right to us , in our archaeological roots .
now what &amp; apos ; s fascinating is that the tactic otapes , which are contained in the liane , are actually the kinds of things that are necessary to multiply the trintamines . so you ask yourself .
the last example that i have time to show you today is a music array of live admissions that we &amp; apos ; ve recently developed , and in the sidelines as sounds like lead voice , bathing and sletter .
because i think that the interactive media in us is engaging in archaeological , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long , very long time ago , and that we can create them again through interactive media .
because that &amp; apos ; s when i turn my hand away from you so that you can see it from the back , this finger moves , my finger , just from where he was , in a position where he &amp; apos ; s so stressed .
when the golfing corporation got rid of their 10 worst selling cascades , they experienced that the profits went up at 87 percent -- a result of the increase in sales and sales of cost .
and it gets better than that , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , http video and photo , libraries of books and music , technology for medical diagnostics -- are now literally becoming materialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
what you have to do there may seem simple , but that &amp; apos ; s not it . you &amp; apos ; ve got to get all the co2 that comes out of the block after you get out of your stone , capture under pressure and then store it somewhere and hope it stays there .
now i have to admit , when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time , but every year it &amp; apos ; s gone up to my greater doubt .
as a result , he &amp; apos ; s now very prone to these schizophrenic phases , and they &amp; apos ; re sometimes so bad , and he &amp; apos ; s gone away in the streets of skid row , and he &amp; apos ; s always moving around this horror and the depressurance of his own mind .
so now , if i do this , the professionals in the crime scene , go to the place , collect some hair samples , and then turn them on this method , and then you can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person .
and it turns out that among a $ 60,000 per year , for americans , it &amp; apos ; s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &amp; apos ; s a large representative sample , under a 600,000 dollars a year .
i mean , if i &amp; apos ; m in the elevator alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then i add other people to it , and i listen to all these things because i don &amp; apos ; t want to hurt them , or frankly , i &amp; apos ; m going to mess up .
i &amp; apos ; m happy to say that we don &amp; apos ; t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago who had brought some siemas twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
to put these theories up , we think that it &amp; apos ; s definitely very high school days , it &amp; apos ; s got to be a very high ##AT##-##AT## end goal , and it &amp; apos ; s very likely in iran , because most infections are signed up there .
that , as a translation , not just to mention word for the text in a different language , but also to understand the deeper meaning of words and words , so that it makes a useful translation , everybody knows that it has to do it with foreign languages .
we took a p3 ##AT##-##AT## d camera , we took it apart , we put it on a led ##AT##-##AT## light , and now we put a device that &amp; apos ; s free -- you can build it yourself , we put the code for free , the software you can download for free .
i &amp; apos ; m from the house of house , so i &amp; apos ; m also involved , of course , with the topic of curiosity , and how the curiosity is changing again , and why we might lose curiosity , and why we might need to reiterate it again and so on .
it &amp; apos ; s -- what i &amp; apos ; ve done is i &amp; apos ; ve taken this code -- it &amp; apos ; s made out of normal letters that we use to symbolize -- and i &amp; apos ; ve written my visifications to a piece of dna , and i &amp; apos ; ve written it 10 times more ^ 22 times .
i met these guys of grind , graffiti lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface and then draw a laser pointer on it that only registered the negative area .
what we &amp; apos ; ve learned from cross ##AT##-##AT## cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- tend to be more complex social relationships and care about people who are vulnerable within the group are very , very interested .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &amp; apos ; s going to become available to the information technology technology , on the curve of moore &amp; apos ; s law , is huge jumps , and the price performance is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
in the process of doing this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people willing to save or pay four percent increase in the amount that they were willing to pay for the savings accounts .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembered self , and you can think of the memory itself as one that sort of sticks the living yourself through experiences that the living self doesn &amp; apos ; t need .
this was a huge outcry at the time , because , of course , you know , you started to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what &amp; apos ; s called fluid and alive , and i &amp; apos ; m going to start making it into stone and i &amp; apos ; m also manipulating it .
if a character in spain did something unexpected , something magical : <unk> h lah , ol√© , ol√© , allah , allah , great , bravo , it &amp; apos ; s a glimpse of god .
if you allow someone to activate their own inner forces -- the human mind is so <unk> tional -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment open a door , you &amp; apos ; re a very good teacher for these people .
what we &amp; apos ; ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slow and scary -- obviously , in trying to make warcraft fun , so that they wouldn &amp; apos ; t be able to get there fast .
that is , i &amp; apos ; ve actually got you to realize that you don &amp; apos ; t recognize any pattern in there anymore , but i &amp; apos ; ve put it in perspective in a very short time , and i &amp; apos ; ve seen this dog in this working ##AT##-##AT## out picture .
so there &amp; apos ; s a lot of grand challenges here : there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , the energy source is out there outside the country , you don &amp; apos ; t just need the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that energy comes from where it comes from .
and that &amp; apos ; s what we need to see in millions of faces around the world , when we attack the barriers of the next century , the face of all odds that are on the edge of an episode .
the reason why kids grew up with this kind of body -- whether it &amp; apos ; s or not , siemas twins , it &amp; apos ; s sexually adapted -- by many times , surgeons , to the norm , it &amp; apos ; s not because it &amp; apos ; s their physical health benefits .
it &amp; apos ; s a process , and sometimes it doesn &amp; apos ; t work , and sometimes it doesn &amp; apos ; t work , but the idea that we shouldn &amp; apos ; t allow science to do their work , because we &amp; apos ; re afraid we &amp; apos ; re going to have a real ending , and it keeps millions of people from blooming .
now if you take this picture -- i &amp; apos ; m originally italian , and every young boy in italy grows up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &amp; apos ; m showing you this is because in the formula one in the last one decades something very interesting happened .
you know , the genocide , the phyllis extinction in general by people , but the ethnic nominee , the destruction of people &amp; apos ; s lifestyle , not just being convicted , but celebrated in general , and celebrated as part of a development strategy .
so we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there &amp; apos ; s no bioagriculture , no <unk> , no <unk> ine , no nature ##AT##-##AT## street benzene , and as they all say , it means that our own excreations will allow us to go back .
if we can change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water memory , inside it , that you can just go back to cellulose , you can plant it with a baby in israel or in tunisia , in hundreds of thousands of trees .
it would be worse , though , if i didn &amp; apos ; t remember that i told you about 20 years ago that when i was a teenager for the first time that i wanted to be a writer , i wanted to be confronted with the same kind of fear response .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of life , the existence of life is divided into single ##AT##-##AT## cell organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is being kept in both death cells .
they empowered us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie today , that we use mris to piss down the brain centers in order to make advertising both advertising and movies .
so if you &amp; apos ; ve got this idea that you &amp; apos ; re somehow driven in nature , you &amp; apos ; re kind of compromised , you &amp; apos ; re withheld from the larger crowd , you &amp; apos ; ve got to feel like there &amp; apos ; s something that needs to be free .
of course , the stories that i picked up were the stories from the science fiction section : &amp; quot ; terminator , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; aliens , &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; abyss . &amp; quot ;
immediately after that election , between the 21st and february 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 dogs went to the two places in the world that were most interested in getting into the business of urbanism .
here &amp; apos ; s a photograph i took in the northern part of the pacific gyre when i went hunting with intrusts on the narrines , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &amp; apos ; 80s when i just started in elementary school , and it began to build my self ##AT##-##AT## portrait outside my family and shape , also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and they &amp; apos ; ve written this information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we &amp; apos ; ve got a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria are communicating with each other .
he escaped the dog and improvised it , took the skeleton of the dog &amp; apos ; s dog &amp; apos ; s dog , and he improvised a sleek , and he placed another dog on the wall , and decided to hang on the ice with the pebble of the chip .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to put up a stereo -- speaker , cpd ##AT##-##AT## player , radio , radio , radio , radio . and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo plants .
i &amp; apos ; ve been studying molecular biology , and i &amp; apos ; ve been doing a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i &amp; apos ; ve just started this because i just wanted to know it , and i wanted to do it more specifically , and i wanted to do everything i &amp; apos ; ve learned in college .
and finally , just before you don &amp; apos ; t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put him on the top , step back and admire &amp; quot ; tada ! &amp; quot ; you admire your work .
and i &amp; apos ; m just holding one of these little devices up because things are supposed to be more intuitive , more and more natural , more convenient , more convenient , and you &amp; apos ; ve got to look at what &amp; apos ; s really natural for us , which is good for us , or intuitive .
if i were to take this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone would see me as a person who can run their lives in a positive way , but today i will be celebrated for the opportunities and adventure that i &amp; apos ; ve experienced .
at the time , it &amp; apos ; s kind of like a front line , where adolus , clerus and others have said , you &amp; apos ; re actually crazy when people start reading , then they want to talk to each other , and , of course , that &amp; apos ; s completely fine .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in high ##AT##-##AT## regulated countries , is high , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , even though the human work doesn &amp; apos ; t use the fuel for weapons .
we set up an internet site , and we asked a crowd of people , &amp; quot ; if you see an aed , please share with us where he is , &amp; quot ; because sometimes it &amp; apos ; s closed during business times , of course .
and finally , i think that although it &amp; apos ; s so dramatic , it &amp; apos ; s so beautiful , it &amp; apos ; s so inspiring , and so inspiring , at the end of the day , we &amp; apos ; re not measured by our technology , not by the things we &amp; apos ; re developing , not by our intellect and minds .
i started working with this scientific literature on how this centrifuge is built in nashness , and it turns out they &amp; apos ; re structured in what we call cascades , and every cascade has 164 centuries ##AT##-##AT## centrifuge .
just because of the fact that maria was born for three months , she goes through all sorts of right rights three months before hini -- the right to have sex with the right to pick the right to drink .
but , as we think , the only way biology will have a huge impact without further increases in the cost of food , or the limitation of its availability when we see co2 as the output material , and therefore we &amp; apos ; re working on cells that are going away .
the minds can be ridiculed by the great water under the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance to push the soul of the living temporary , so that the <unk> ar becomes a brief moment for the god .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me has shaped as a powerful and powerful young girl my self ##AT##-##AT## portrait , and i could imagine looking at myself as a nature of strong , powerful and dignified human being .
that means you &amp; apos ; ve found yourself talking about a common language , you could communicate with one another , you could pull in the same cave or you &amp; apos ; ve moved to other areas , you &amp; apos ; ve created cities or you &amp; apos ; ve created villages and you &amp; apos ; ve created &amp; quot ; tribal society . &amp; quot ;
i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything &amp; apos ; s from the video camera to professional traffic jams , a pretty large number of them that are all put together in this environment .
now we &amp; apos ; ve got three bullets laws , which bring people all the time behind bars , for a bike ride , for the theft of theft , for the theft of less good things , rather than forcing them to give back the things to the victims .
the question is quite simple , if you &amp; apos ; re completely self ##AT##-##AT## sustainable from any of the fossil or energetic grown ##AT##-##AT## ups that are coming out somewhere in the world and being brought to you , you &amp; apos ; re an island .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &amp; apos ; t go in the front of the front , and it says , &amp; quot ; well , look , look at it again , and i &amp; apos ; m sure if you see what you see , that &amp; apos ; s what you want to see .
but if we can do it , it &amp; apos ; s an effective wind ##AT##-##AT## down virus on a laptop that &amp; apos ; s used by a warm manufacturing tool to conserve that gray box , then we &amp; apos ; re in business .
now , buying a glass of glass for us is probably good for us -- at least it &amp; apos ; s good for our taiping -- but it turns out that the decision trucks also affect us in a very consistent way .
but that &amp; apos ; s my prototype like this , but it &amp; apos ; s pretty much taken off , so on a branch , the thing on it , electronics , pressure , and that &amp; apos ; s the pressure , the thing that &amp; apos ; s broken .
now this could have happened within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information has been evolutionarily learned by the individuals who died because of these fruit flies , because these information processing structures haven &amp; apos ; t been available yet .
and because i was born with no legs , and my feet turned to them , and i just had a few toes on that , and some toes on the other foot was the outliers , and this strangers had to overlay the bad news .
i &amp; apos ; m a historian of historical scientists , and in this case , i study how humans went to anatomy -- that &amp; apos ; s the human body , animal bodies -- as they were with liquid liquids , with body concepts , as they &amp; apos ; ve thought about their bodies .
but when i was interviewing him , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- they were highly risky surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , those kids would get very bad , and that &amp; apos ; s why he had to do it .
there are challenges in life and challenges , and they &amp; apos ; re just too ubiquitous , and each person &amp; apos ; s doing it differently , but the question is not whether we can get there with visionaries or not , but how we get it .
what if we could turn this situation around , and put the internet on its head , so that instead of going from one to another , we start to be able to go from many things to many things , and by seeing patterns that would have gone missing ?
when we &amp; apos ; re in a game world , i think many of us are turning to our best version , and at any given time , aid is ready to try and solve the problem , as long as it takes , to try again .
we see this when i design things , i can make them confusing , like on the right side , where i don &amp; apos ; t know what &amp; apos ; s salt and pepper , or i can kind of abstract it by showing things .
you don &amp; apos ; t worry that you &amp; apos ; re going to go back and never come out of your life and never come out of it and you &amp; apos ; re going to die on a scrap of closed dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitch of the killing ?
dg : exactly . today , you have to refill the reactor all the time , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and you put things in -- or get it out . it &amp; apos ; s not good !
and wherever you see yourself in the world , you &amp; apos ; ll discover that these cultures are not the decimal of the collapse . these are dynamic peoples whose existence is now being forced by <unk> able forces to move beyond their capacity . whether it &amp; apos ; s the monstrous deforestation in the country on the back of the country , on a maiden island of south asia , from sarajevo , from sarajevo , from a generation , whose people live in the forest , and now they &amp; apos ; re located in the river , where they &amp; apos ; re almost half of the east coast of the pacific river , where they &amp; apos ; re being locked in the pacific river , where they &amp; apos ; re located , where they &amp; apos ; re being locked in the gulf of mexico , where they &amp; apos ; re located .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content to make it realistic for them , and they actually live without oil . so if they raise their game , they tell us where they live . and then they get movies in real time that show them how much oil costs , what &amp; apos ; s not like , what &amp; apos ; s it like , how do they affect food , how do they affect transportation , whether it &amp; apos ; s closed schools that are closed , and how do they have to figure out whether they &amp; apos ; re real , and if they &amp; apos ; re going to map their lives , or whether they &amp; apos ; re going to map it &amp; apos ; s true .
what ayuatia does so fascinating is not just the pharmacological potential of this premise , but its processing . it &amp; apos ; s really made up of two different sources , but there &amp; apos ; s a side , there &amp; apos ; s this wooden peacock that &amp; apos ; s mixing a series of carnas , harlan , it &amp; apos ; s easy , hallucinating , hallucinating , and it &amp; apos ; s like he &amp; apos ; s going to be a blue smoke that &amp; apos ; s attached to her consciousness , but it &amp; apos ; s made out of a coffee , and it &amp; apos ; s mixed with the family of a coffee shop .
just knowing that jaundra &amp; apos ; s shaman still goes beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the myths of the elders of the elderly are still meaningful meaning , or that in the himalayas , the most buddhas is still pursuing the breath of dharasma , the central revelation of memory , which is the idea that the world in which we live in , not in an absolute sense , but a model of reality , as a result of a group of the possibilities of our different generations ago .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter whether it &amp; apos ; s the pension of borneo in the woods of borneo forests , or the vootaku in haiti , or the warrior of north africa , which is not a curtain of north africa , or a caraung san francisco in the middle of the sahara desert . this is the colleague that i visited a month ago in the desert , or even a dehygil &amp; apos ; s , or a moqa , in the world of al qaeda , the mother of mt .
of course , from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , my laser surgery for vision , knee replacement , knee joints , artificial joints , and artificial joints for aging , that allow people to really use all of their possibilities and move beyond the limits that they &amp; apos ; ve tried to develop their natural fate , can &amp; apos ; t even speak of social networking platforms , giving people an identity in their own way , and therefore reflect on their own communities around the world .
