thanks for you patience .
dark urine . dark .
but the point is ...
these changes are coming .
good afternoon , everybody .
so here it is .
an almost identical structure .
but it gets worse .
is that your opinion ?
turn the camera off .
next would be nuclear .
yeah . all right .
after only one trip .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
and so i did .
and the family gathered .
he kept pointing here .
there were still fishes .
and i always have been .
they called me .
very scary .
i swear .
why do this ?
thankfully , right ?
and then presented .
be a mentor .
it feels great .
ban is blank .
and then it went international .
i was devastated .
but i felt worse .
they really loved it .
the orange tractor .
inventing his own narrative .
so what why hacking ?
lento , slow .
it goes against justice .
we are a smaller brand .
here you see the city .
first overtime , second .
and then everybody moved down .
he liked it very much .
but it was very sad .
and that worked pretty well .
and it even got better .
your plant can blow up .
it was different in china .
that is a fantastic question .
my name is amit .
and it took 18 months .
keep going . have fun .
and the answer is no .
okay , a bit more .
there were remixes .
leave that up to us .
so what happened years afterward ?
will i like the color ?
but we need this everywhere .
we say sustainability in germany .
because you can train that .
what needed to be done ?
i wanted to support them .
he pointed at the algae .
want to feed the world ?
and why is it true ?
yes , there it is .
he had had the experience .
this is an old study .
and here is a surprise .
you have that much uncertainty .
some have come and gone .
who does the very best ?
and those days are gone .
privacy is implied .
they sell <<unk>> ates .
these guys make money .
we have online criminals .
so what happens here ?
1,000 , very good .
hey , why not ?
what creates the illusion ?
or is it photography ?
my hunches again .
he is my grandfather .
so what happened here ?
how engaged you are .
but you know what ?
the first : cut .
can we do this differently ?
this is the last one .
what is the media today ?
does anyone see anything specific ?
we can do it differently .
and it must go back .
does that make you curious ?
you make comparisons .
an autistic pupil .
and i was an artist .
so this is a wish .
bg : thank you .
why do we do that ?
because , you know something ?
how do we know that ?
so this is for real .
dk : 60,000 .
what is the soul ?
all that interests me .
that is doable .
robert gupta .
what did they do ?
there is no feed .
can i be honest ?
sound familiar ? right .
what was the result ?
and i understand that .
people were going crazy .
the data came back .
but you know what ?
pretty good , right ?
yeah , i know .
so i made one .
this is really exciting .
oh , that guy .
quite a few more .
maybe 10 times more .
he answers the door .
why not live longer ?
who are these cousins ?
thank you very much .
italy wins . yeah .
here is the video .
i was in awe .
you could see manhattan .
so they know everything .
jk : both .
it keeps you fresh .
i don &amp; apos ; t believe that .
isn &amp; apos ; t that awesome ?
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
and that &amp; apos ; s important .
but i carried on with my work .
don &amp; apos ; t be daunted .
yes , that &amp; apos ; s possible .
why does this happen in the first place ?
the first two theorems are logically correct .
let &amp; apos ; s call him don .
doesn &amp; apos ; t happen very much .
it &amp; apos ; s not a country .
i &amp; apos ; ve got a question .
they &amp; apos ; re using their hands .
one of two things is going to happen .
it &amp; apos ; s interesting to me .
that &amp; apos ; s very good .
somehow this isn &amp; apos ; t working .
what do you want to do ? &amp; quot ;
so let &amp; apos ; s have a look .
who &amp; apos ; s going to be sure ?
gamers don &amp; apos ; t sit around .
i mean , it &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
i mean , it &amp; apos ; s fascinating .
i &amp; apos ; m going to stop that .
i &amp; apos ; d like to tell you why .
we &amp; apos ; re constantly running into each other .
there &amp; apos ; s nothing poisonous in it .
the soul is something mental , leibniz said .
so i &amp; apos ; m just going to enter in .
it might sound like it &amp; apos ; s a bad thing .
what is decisive , if i &amp; apos ; m right , then it &amp; apos ; s valid .
play is not frivolous .
aww , thank you .
you can enter inside it .
i was exposed to him .
she did it in secret .
this would have been fine .
so let me recap .
so how does it happen ?
and i thought about that .
what will these people want ?
and i memorized everything .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
he was actually collecting fish .
i &amp; apos ; m surprised .
so , you can do it .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
so where do we go ?
huh . hang on a moment .
okay . thank you very much .
let me give you an example .
well she was back all right .
and i went back to work .
this is happening to us today .
that &amp; apos ; s our present .
isn &amp; apos ; t that sad ?
we were a group of twenty people .
that &amp; apos ; s the system .
the farm &amp; apos ; s incredible .
and so , we need energy miracles .
that &amp; apos ; s super important .
it &amp; apos ; s a crisis .
there &amp; apos ; s no normal .
we can do that .
thanks so much .
they actually hurt .
yes , hello .
thanks for listening .
not guilt management .
nothing will happen .
yes , hello .
what a fish .
i actually am .
what about longevity ?
they all matter .
it is generic .
so meet al .
score them again .
and they did .
i represent children .
what would you say ?
but the wrong things .
the whole environmental discussion .
yes , milliseconds .
they have similar principles .
good job ! yeah !
this happened around christmas .
just do your job .
i am a writer .
this was the result .
very expensive real estate .
and he says ...
a few less .
that was us .
it has sensors .
after one week .
which was awesome .
thank you guys .
yeah . okay .
i was amazed .
is that all ?
ohhhh .
we were poor .
centers were established .
this is not ...
solar technology is ...
we love innovation .
the sun is rising .
we love entertainment .
music as language .
explore .
come on .
totally inefficient .
tremendously challenging .
thank you .
... yet .
this is hard .
yes , hello .
we know that .
which is singing .
you need time .
it goes fast .
here it is .
not very sustainable .
ta ##AT##-##AT## da !
very different notion .
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
that &amp; apos ; s wrong .
that &amp; apos ; s efficient .
it &amp; apos ; s horrible .
play &amp; apos ; s essential .
that &amp; apos ; s scary .
i &amp; apos ; m tom .
thank you very much , guys .
that doesn &amp; apos ; t happen .
thank you very much .
it &amp; apos ; s a lot .
i don &amp; apos ; t know .
we &amp; apos ; re losing them .
we &amp; apos ; re taking off .
fantastic , isn &amp; apos ; t it ?
that &amp; apos ; s your only chance .
they had to worry about being bombed .
there &amp; apos ; s no hospital that can say &amp; quot ; no . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s interesting .
it is possible though .
and this was fascinating .
what happens is this .
does that sound good ?
i can help you .
oh , my god !
what does this mean ?
go home to where ?
oh , my god .
a long time , yes .
yes , so to speak .
thank you . thank you .
three times out of 10 .
you know , is it rational ?
what does it mean ?
no kidding .
tremendously exciting .
thank you .
thank you .
nice one .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
from seattle ...
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
maybe not .
thank you .
thanks .
fine .
terrible .
<<unk>> !
this is stephen watt .
thank you .
it &amp; apos ; s true .
it &amp; apos ; s possible .
1.5 million .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
just because of that .
just one single one ?
thank you very much .
fly away , cat .
thank you very much .
thank you so much .
is that something ?
thank you very much .
thank you .
wooo !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
like twice over .
yes , well ...
pretty simple .
positively .
yes .
right ?
right ?
60,000 .
creativity .
yeah .
thanks .
okay .
awesome .
yeah .
unique .
right ?
right ?
sustainable .
right ?
yes ?
right ?
whereas .
yes .
yes .
right ?
why ?
hello !
sort of .
whoa !
thank you .
all right .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
really .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
you see ?
you see ?
you see ?
have you ?
thank you .
thank you .
okay .
no .
what takes twenty ##AT##-##AT## five milliseconds ?
instruments have developed .
or take lipstick .
say what you feel .
at least not to navigate .
but totally effective , right ?
the reasons for writing it .
so , please forgive me .
they literally flipped the switch .
this is an ecological network .
i remember my first fire .
monday : color is powerful .
just be who you are .
everybody applauded politely .
... meaning not so optimistic .
that might sound unusual at first .
the truth is more like this .
third : escalation of expectations .
all of these are consuming questions .
the official dogma of what ?
talk about getting by with nothing .
now look at this curve .
so scott gets this call .
he died broken by history .
he retreated into silence .
so the white lines here are population .
you should ask for some of that .
and i began giving her my rap .
i talk a lot about these issues .
today , there are 2.3 million .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
now we do the same with airplanes .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
something really weird is going on here .
and that &amp; apos ; s nothing .
i felt like anyone could do that .
i never knew him in real life .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
we went and looked at a site .
he showed it to javier .
and really you do the same thing .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
now this is one of the images .
those are juxtaposed very nicely together .
it &amp; apos ; s completely directed .
this picture &amp; apos ; s from there .
and then some very funny things happened .
i founded an institute with this in mind .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
that &amp; apos ; s cool , huh ?
now , who &amp; apos ; s normal ?
so , this crazy story might be true .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
there &amp; apos ; s almost nothing left .
it &amp; apos ; s a natural thing .
we can apply these things to other examples .
he was over sixty at the time .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
and so there are too many of us .
it &amp; apos ; s entirely insignificant .
and then i can transfer the whole thing .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
a has these benefits , and these risks .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
but there are two problems with that .
i began to feel a bit better .
but , but , you know what ?
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
she did it for three years .
now we talk about water wars .
i mean , that was epic .
so what was the next step ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
so i followed my hunches .
no had never been an option .
this is not a finished story .
so what happened on this day ?
and so we measured its motion .
you can be logical and intuitive .
she was back and near death .
and this video is real time .
this data was not available before .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
now how could this come about ?
how many people would choose creativity ?
okay , we can do that .
they are building an epic story .
it is a completely different notion .
you have not changed the story .
if you burn coal , no .
and so that got me very excited .
you can play with a different type .
the whole building is made of water .
and that was 19 yeas ago .
which one would you like the most ?
blissful productivity . i love it .
and he actually says it that way .
and it just disturbed me so much .
what should our report card look like ?
it is kind of a crazy idea .
if you burn natural gas , no .
so tempt is now completely paralyzed .
one billion people will go hungry today .
that must be our difference in age .
so not like a detox .
these are cell phones of the future .
the bricks are color ##AT##-##AT## coded .
they were still kind of happy .
this was my first sunburn .
my name is brian goldman .
she shares her experience with others .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
that &amp; apos ; s how things of nature are imagined .
we all love baseball , don &amp; apos ; t we ?
we &amp; apos ; re harnessing energy from the sun .
and somehow kids don &amp; apos ; t do that anymore .
that &amp; apos ; s about a 15 ##AT##-##AT## foot boat .
they &amp; apos ; re becoming like computers in open air .
it shouldn &amp; apos ; t take away from other things .
and that &amp; apos ; s why i made the movie .
because technologically it &amp; apos ; s just not possible .
and you &amp; apos ; ll have a problem right away .
he &amp; apos ; ll automatically go to the right thought .
and the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops .
so that &amp; apos ; s reassuring , you know .
and it &amp; apos ; s been an incredible experience .
i don &amp; apos ; t take the same history .
and they don &amp; apos ; t tell us much .
now we didn &amp; apos ; t write this app .
they haven &amp; apos ; t given up on government .
it &amp; apos ; s this , just like this .
here &amp; apos ; s a description of the road .
and so that &amp; apos ; s what we did .
it &amp; apos ; s to supplement the experience .
it &amp; apos ; s ideology , it &amp; apos ; s not science .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not tv , the internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise .
this this hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can &amp; apos ; t say that out loud .
and moreover , you don &amp; apos ; t tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up .
so i &amp; apos ; m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
there &amp; apos ; s no insurance company that can say &amp; quot ; no . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s separating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
but there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire .
i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &amp; apos ; t .
it is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function .
tell me what you &amp; apos ; re trying to do . &amp; quot ;
so this is all of the meta ##AT##-##AT## data information .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a <<unk>> ophobe .
there &amp; apos ; s world records that are on this as well .
somehow this isn &amp; apos ; t working out , is it ?
and i &amp; apos ; m going to admit something to you .
now i &amp; apos ; ve been talking a lot about magic .
it &amp; apos ; s about as far as we go out .
that wouldn &amp; apos ; t have been a problem at all .
i <<unk>> red to that kind of normalcy back then .
now , that &amp; apos ; s not necessarily a bad thing .
that was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
that &amp; apos ; s god , you know .
so let &amp; apos ; s start with sunday .
who doesn &amp; apos ; t want healthier children ?
we have reached a kind of equipoise .
and the form has something to do with it .
so , paul &amp; apos ; s a terrorist .
don &amp; apos ; t take anything for granted .
so that &amp; apos ; s the good news .
that can &amp; apos ; t be a problem .
it just hadn &amp; apos ; t been invented .
otherwise you couldn &amp; apos ; t have teeth .
that &amp; apos ; s usually not the route .
i think it &amp; apos ; s odious .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
and one time we caught a live one .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
you &amp; apos ; re an inspiring person .
it &amp; apos ; s not our burden .
and then my brother started staring at me .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
he &amp; apos ; s wasting his time on nonsense .
we &amp; apos ; ve gotta figure out which brands .
we &amp; apos ; ve won a bunch of awards .
it &amp; apos ; s morning , before the match .
but i don &amp; apos ; t buy anything new .
play is not just child &amp; apos ; s games .
no one &amp; apos ; s ever said that before .
i mean , i &amp; apos ; m a journalist .
and so that &amp; apos ; s a big challenge .
they &amp; apos ; re feasting . &amp; quot ;
and of course that &amp; apos ; s incredibly slow .
okay , there &amp; apos ; s some .
so you could call it the translation of a translation .
if at the moment they &amp; apos ; re waste .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
and there &amp; apos ; s hundreds of them .
it &amp; apos ; s not moving like that .
all right , let &amp; apos ; s go .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
they even can bring with them some financing .
i probably shouldn &amp; apos ; t say that .
something shoots through my head .
so let me remind you .
everybody needs a fishbowl .
like that , you know .
and what is that thing ?
give pee a chance .
zero emissions , you see ?
so two cycles are created .
were you ever envious ?
and how did you feel ?
you could have done better .
my wife told me it .
i highlighted it here .
here you have it again .
thank you for your attention .
2.5 to one , great .
they were seeing something magical .
architects and engineers , thankfully .
and i tried something interesting .
what defines a story ?
superior technology .
that was all .
wonderful , right ?
how about fitness ?
it sounds scary .
what what happened there ?
another very exciting phenomenon .
imagine mozart being efficient .
and it really changed the dynamic .
finally : epic meaning .
is it just imaginary ?
what else is risky ?
um , my brand ?
one is south korea .
why should i worry ?
lego made it accessible .
they speared each other .
we can win back our nutrients .
we design unique elements into this .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
that image reminded me of something .
this is a game for outside .
for example perception in this context .
does anybody know what this is ?
we are dependent on two countries .
and we absorb all of it .
so the correlation is low .
the side product is clean water .
because to me it means memory .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
they then also say , why ?
that will take place next april .
the chef had overcooked it .
i almost never cook with it .
same thing , only bigger .
this is a dead turtle .
our magazines are read by millions .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
well , i was next .
and women successfully argued that .
the match begins -- silence .
you saw the big peak .
so that started the journey .
he turns off the engines .
i like really nice clothes .
tell me about this world .
i see this plus sign .
think about your own choices .
her mother raised her alone .
i sometimes push too hard .
they had been pushed genetically .
that was more for emphasis .
you can see this at the bottom .
why not think about it this way ?
here &amp; apos ; s another example .
we go through initiation rites .
privacy is not up for discussion .
the only country in the world .
and it opens up a map .
and this made me really sad .
they sort of go like this .
is it something about the light ?
it really comes from these artists .
and apparently it was quite popular .
and i grew up in india .
what other brands are like that ?
you can see the water coming .
so you can have this cloud .
and that has to do with phosphorus .
every bit of waste is a nutrient .
most people here have heard of them .
and here you have the graphic again .
it was really , really quite profound .
we need to get the message out .
the data says it all the time .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
but it hadn &amp; apos ; t .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
is it going to be my size ?
that &amp; apos ; s very risky .
what am i going to look at ?
but what are we doing with it ?
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
we &amp; apos ; ve been disconnected .
well , what does that mean ?
it connected those two people .
i lived in parallel worlds .
have you seen these guys ?
there are billions of them .
but they do the job .
i never will forget it .
i will never forget it .
it will get to you .
crisis . death . disaster .
and many people forget this .
and i felt really good .
and then it happened again .
you always lose rare animals .
we have three main groups .
now , what does that mean ?
i wanted to keep us healthy .
do you want them distressed ?
how do we humans actually function ?
it won &amp; apos ; t .
but where are we of use ?
the work of the interpreter .
they flooded the canals .
but what are your fish eating ?
this is a lot of volume .
and it was a huge success .
and then they execute on it .
what do you think happened then ?
his name is paul offit .
that does not hold for emotions .
we made this game in 2007 .
i want to ask a question .
and that &amp; apos ; s it . thank you .
let &amp; apos ; s call him don too .
i don &amp; apos ; t love that question .
it &amp; apos ; s been constantly going up .
first , we &amp; apos ; ve got population .
i &amp; apos ; ve lived a good life .
that &amp; apos ; s the two ##AT##-##AT## cent tour .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and there &amp; apos ; s good news here .
the other nurse asked matter ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## factly .
and fortunately he didn &amp; apos ; t die .
that &amp; apos ; s something we have to understand .
it will start to look more and more like you .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t taste very good either .
you don &amp; apos ; t want to do that ?
this guy &amp; apos ; s name is tempt .
that &amp; apos ; s exemplary .
that &amp; apos ; s about all it can do .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
he &amp; apos ; s the dude on the left .
we can &amp; apos ; t get rid of it .
they didn &amp; apos ; t have books , after all .
you wouldn &amp; apos ; t be able to have bones .
today they &amp; apos ; re called project executing organizations .
and you wouldn &amp; apos ; t be able to save energy .
so , i &amp; apos ; m going to wrap up now .
perhaps instead , of what &amp; apos ; s really going on .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
and now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , i can do something with this .
we maybe even &amp; # 91 ; have &amp; # 93 ; it in our cellphone .
that means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories .
i don &amp; apos ; t think so .
we love technology . we love creativity .
he kept pacing back and forth .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
i wouldn &amp; apos ; t recommend it .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
and this is felix , actually .
but that &amp; apos ; s not protection .
logic does not make any statements about reality .
four and a half thousand people live there .
i &amp; apos ; ve loved only two .
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
this is the one with the greatest impact .
so , what do we have to do ?
and it &amp; apos ; s pretty amazing .
i &amp; apos ; m totally with you .
it would be un<<unk>> onable .
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
that &amp; apos ; s a great question .
so here &amp; apos ; s another example .
but it does require a lot of planning .
but there &amp; apos ; s another thing .
it &amp; apos ; s not our problem .
it &amp; apos ; s not our struggle .
i couldn &amp; apos ; t bear it .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
but it &amp; apos ; s not documented .
they didn &amp; apos ; t have mass media .
and that means there are too many of us .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t have this soul .
i want to help you calm down .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
so littlebits is open ##AT##-##AT## source .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
and it was what i was feeling .
and he whispered in my ear .
so scott was speaking person ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## person .
it might take a moment to load .
grants and sponsors were sought .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
thursday : confidence is key .
they had a concept of blue blood .
both are viable ; both take off .
i was trying to preserve the body .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
this is true . i believe this .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
it makes them feel good . &amp; quot ;
we have measles in this country now .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
we vanquished it . puff .
we need to go for more research funding .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
those were the first calculations six years ago .
a particularly nice story , in my opinion .
so it &amp; apos ; s a circle .
and just to say , what is information ?
and his whole work process changed after that .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
and this picture was taken by atlas .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
there are . there always are .
we still think it is pristine .
and this is about shifting baseline .
they stopped us from being inspired .
here are two different jewelry displays .
i think this is really cool .
you can zoom around very simply .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
the captain waved me over .
what do you think happens next ?
the company headquarters are right here .
he shook his head , no .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
we have twenty percent in germany .
a <<unk>> matian , exactly .
this is an annual melting river .
they actually make us worse off .
we think about energy scarcity .
jimmy kimmel actually .
the flows have increased .
from the modern to the computer society .
you can drill into a particular year .
say , there are no predictors .
these nappies are everywhere practically .
but with the right design , please .
so we must get the phosphorus back .
we can support them in doing good .
we can support them in doing good .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
then i see the <<unk>> matian .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
that is exactly what you are doing .
so these were my prime motives .
now i put a bass line in .
we need to go far , quickly .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
this is the machine below geneva .
they laughed more than you guys are .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
it &amp; apos ; s part of our life .
the first on here is the classic , apple .
i &amp; apos ; m a redundant person .
so again , that was a real good match .
so that made sense , that was a match .
but in practice , how do you do it ?
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
this is about one percent of the total population .
that is the sole test of survival and success .
ohhhhh , wowwww !
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
normally now , i would take the needle out .
so , let me give you a little peek .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
they become rarer because we fish them .
i have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this .
so not saving , abstaining from , avoiding .
that proves it , doesn &amp; apos ; t it ?
and there &amp; apos ; s one central point here .
it &amp; apos ; s about repowering america .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
in other domains -- the world of communications .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
because i have nothing to hide . &amp; quot ;
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
it &amp; apos ; s called batting average .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
how do i get this removed ? &amp; quot ;
life hadn &amp; apos ; t changed for centuries .
well it was a friday , this is true .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
how could we help you ? &amp; quot ;
and here every piece is very well planned .
but so many over the years were helped .
someone made an old timey version .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
tell me a little bit about that part .
they need to tell me about my brand .
and here can you see the whole thing again .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
it &amp; apos ; s called the cloud .
here &amp; apos ; s the building working .
so that was the reason for the project .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
let me tell you a bit about it .
tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
thank you , danny kahneman .
you know , i was a real science geek .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
a lot of my clients are very young .
especially if he &amp; apos ; s already dead .
of course not everything should be compostable .
every footprint is disadvanta<<unk>> there .
when you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
but phosphorus will not be able to be replaced .
and we can see that it can be done .
protect the environment , produce less rubbish .
that &amp; apos ; s also a paradigm shift .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
it &amp; apos ; s nothing if not ambitious .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
the three words are : do you remember ?
i &amp; apos ; m happy to be here .
we &amp; apos ; ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
we don &amp; apos ; t have that kind of situation .
i call this &amp; quot ; shiny tiger . &amp; quot ;
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
the film hasn &amp; apos ; t even been distributed yet .
that &amp; apos ; s more than 250 hundred ##AT##-##AT## thousand acres .
and i &amp; apos ; d like you to read it .
and we &amp; apos ; re actually doing some litigation .
do you want to come over and listen ? &amp; quot ;
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
to what we &amp; apos ; re thinking from a northern perspective .
but it doesn &amp; apos ; t have to end there .
no . i &amp; apos ; m serious . i am .
now , that &amp; apos ; s just an insurance policy .
if this doesn &amp; apos ; t work , then what ?
what am i appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
we have something that &amp; apos ; s not going up .
it &amp; apos ; s the most powerful thing you own .
that &amp; apos ; s how people imagine the soul works .
no , no , that &amp; apos ; s not possible .
to ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ?
i don &amp; apos ; t know who <<unk>> ises what .
here , he &amp; apos ; s bringing the sun out .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to do something about the death penalty .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
a third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul .
we &amp; apos ; re still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage .
i &amp; apos ; ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
it &amp; apos ; s simple , that &amp; apos ; s what will happen .
and this is an argument , which doesn &amp; apos ; t make sense .
if you don &amp; apos ; t know it already , this is coming .
it &amp; apos ; s gone . it &amp; apos ; s vanished .
they don &amp; apos ; t spend time jockeying for power .
so , i &amp; apos ; m going to start with some simple examples .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
it &amp; apos ; s all compostable all of it .
thanks . i haven &amp; apos ; t come to the best part .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
but i &amp; apos ; m going to ask you a question .
we don &amp; apos ; t like to talk about our history .
we don &amp; apos ; t really know very much about it .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
i &amp; apos ; m going to deal directly with the artist .
it &amp; apos ; s all coming out of our own pockets .
because we don &amp; apos ; t want to move genes around ?
there &amp; apos ; s a lot that has to come together .
and , finally , this storage problem .
do we really want to go there ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
these will be irresistible .
but what will come in the future ?
people were suffering . people were fighting .
five million people use it every month .
daniel kahneman : sure .
everybody would like to make people happier .
i hold the knife in my hand .
this has nothing to do with science .
we talk about it ambivalently .
and that can make a big difference .
you see the timeline on the top .
this is really cool . &amp; quot ;
i could draw . i could paint .
so with that , i thank you .
and i see greg lemond now .
feasting ? i was totally confused .
they reversed the flow of water .
thinking , you know , two percent .
music is medicine . music changes us .
how far would you get with that ?
so the first step towards an interpretation .
if you think about it , right ?
and every morning i hop on it .
and what does that mean to a designer ?
they are usually forgotten by the third term .
perhaps we should take another look at this .
i would like to prove that to you .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
but today , it goes beyond that .
what do you do with <<unk>> ates ?
and i thought i could blend in .
this was the sailfin grouper .
what will these three billion people bring ?
because we live on a water planet .
that which i just presented to you .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
this is a photograph of the object .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
you move around , you have fun .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
he only has use of his eyes .
and that was the onset of als .
but the reality is far from it .
you can go all the way through .
the roof also is covered with water .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
something stiffened inside me .
all the adults knew the risks .
even cats were watching this video .
the third technique : categorization .
now we see the opposite effect .
i like things that are different .
you brought your pictures , right ?
we talk about bold , fresh .
i went to prison -- difficult .
will it be under $ 20 ?
let me read you the entry .
that was the first upright primate .
we worked well into each night .
we object to genetically engineered food .
we certainly need one to succeed .
she kind of set us up .
so , i just started playing .
and then we said , okay ,
we were given very accurate data .
yes , here is the data .
over the hills and all that .
do you know what envy is ?
how and what did they feel ?
it causes leukemia in children .
it was not drowned yet .
you can show that you were there .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
first you see from back to front .
to the book and to the image .
was a very a very fancy project .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
seriously -- doomed , doomed !
the new chromosome went into the cell .
we started this over 15 years ago .
and there are several reasons for this .
156 nations carry our television channel .
they will tap your internet connection .
we can re ##AT##-##AT## invent things all over again .
i am a redefined physician .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
why did i go into medicine ?
i had written these crazy things .
i represent people on death row .
and there is this stunning silence .
it can know where we are .
and those are the neural structures .
this is a modest little app .
but it has an unexpected twist .
defeat would have come too easily .
i do get tired , as we all do .
and it still isn &amp; apos ; t an interpretation .
in this way , every concert is a different concert .
there is not one single tree that is carbon neutral .
it &amp; apos ; s just a little less destruction .
it &amp; apos ; s the so ##AT##-##AT## called osit model .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
they &amp; apos ; re homelands of somebody .
you can have a succession of changes .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
so it &amp; apos ; s right in the middle .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
over here , these are the apsaras .
so that worked . so booya for scott .
no one has to green ##AT##-##AT## light your idea .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
here &amp; apos ; s their jam aisle .
and i &amp; apos ; ve never seen them .
and it &amp; apos ; s also very risky .
didn &amp; apos ; t make sense to me .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
and here you can see roberto dancing .
that &amp; apos ; s a painting of a circle .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
and she &amp; apos ; s hitting a 257 .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
but perhaps that &amp; apos ; s not the case .
and that &amp; apos ; s a very sensible question .
and we &amp; apos ; ve had some fantastic presentations .
storytelling is becoming more and more multi ##AT##-##AT## sensorial .
so it &amp; apos ; s feeding back on itself .
oh , that &amp; apos ; s all my time ?
here &amp; apos ; s their olive oil aisle .
well , that &amp; apos ; s not quite right .
so let &amp; apos ; s think about the atoms .
but then reality &amp; apos ; s always unpredictable .
it was four and a half years ago in italy .
and you know what i &amp; apos ; ve learned ?
unfortunately , it &amp; apos ; s not much better .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
and it &amp; apos ; s a very easy question .
i &amp; apos ; ll get my sleeve back .
it &amp; apos ; s kind of like a potato .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
but there &amp; apos ; s another reason as well .
well , again , it should have the two elements .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
dosage has something to do with this .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
engines , gearshift -- four choices .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
but then you really want to go deep .
okay , you really want to hear that ?
that &amp; apos ; s easy , huh ?
and i had to get out of town .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
let &amp; apos ; s starting with sensing .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
for a year we were <<unk>> iless .
and the object of this is quite simple .
the result of that has been disastrous .
not even the truth will set them free .
and even lomborg has changed .
also , these are intermittent sources .
the world today has 6.8 billion people .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
i fell out of love with this fish .
these theorems are absolutely logical and correct .
and it will sound completely different from before .
and that &amp; apos ; s just the beginning .
it &amp; apos ; s just better than reality .
so , here &amp; apos ; s what happens .
so that &amp; apos ; s a tough one .
it &amp; apos ; s like learning to speak .
that &amp; apos ; s just about the minimum .
so you can &amp; apos ; t solve that .
so humans can &amp; apos ; t be pigs .
with people , it is released in the urine .
and everything is either the packaging or the contents .
and curiosity can &amp; apos ; t be learned .
he will have to process that as the present .
that the theme of ecology is a global theme .
everybody was having some cake earlier .
for a longer time than these other two networks .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
this is bjorn sundin .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
and here &amp; apos ; s the thing .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
it &amp; apos ; s spreading virally .
the shores are from a different location .
her father died soon after she was born .
in those countries where people have money .
so ants weigh more than we do .
you probably saw it on the news .
... paying attention to crowd ##AT##-##AT## sourcing .
this is an idea worth spreading .
we called it digital water pavilion .
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
and the answer is yes .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
my male uncles died of <<unk>> hol ##AT##-##AT## related diseases .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
and that &amp; apos ; s what these brands did .
so i guess that &amp; apos ; s my brand .
actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
you can see on the left side a small boat .
well , we presented this to mayor belloch .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
i &amp; apos ; m not sure where we go .
and that &amp; apos ; s actually a conservative estimate .
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
this is something that has to get to zero .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
it &amp; apos ; s something we knew how to do .
so that &amp; apos ; s kind of our battle cry .
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
it &amp; apos ; s a complete denial of mistakes .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner .
it &amp; apos ; s hard to overstate the destruction .
here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse .
picasso &amp; apos ; s answer , just wait and see .
everybody is now trying to <<unk>> se something in this pattern .
now i &amp; apos ; ll put some percussion in .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
and we say that word with such contempt .
goodnight sweet opossum . &amp; quot ;
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and i put my challenge on 95 kg .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
we have been here for about 130,000 years .
what we want to do is make the future .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
let me give you good close look at this .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
we &amp; apos ; ve understood that weather is global .
we don &amp; apos ; t companies patenting life .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
do they do that for the children ? &amp; quot ;
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
nobody on this planet has done that in this way .
beginners &amp; apos ; classes hardly talk about interpretation .
it &amp; apos ; s a solemn part .
everything that &amp; apos ; s inside can be utilized .
no , we define what &amp; apos ; s inside .
how can i make something as user friendly as possible ?
you know science isn &amp; apos ; t a company .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
we had to take them out , which we did .
it &amp; apos ; s over 300 million molecular weight .
but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
and actually i become a character in the book .
they &amp; apos ; re obscure , weird programs .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
we are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives .
i &amp; apos ; m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
so in a sense , it &amp; apos ; s getting ahead of us .
but that wasn &amp; apos ; t the end of the opossums .
it &amp; apos ; s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
i didn &amp; apos ; t want to go ; i love my life .
that &amp; apos ; s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
and they &amp; apos ; re not just going to die of measles .
so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
and therefore they &amp; apos ; re not perceived as a big loss .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
here , he &amp; apos ; s pointing out a rare <<unk>> <<unk>> dered kite .
it &amp; apos ; s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
it &amp; apos ; s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
the rest of the time they &amp; apos ; re delocalized .
now it &amp; apos ; s only at precise times when they align .
and that &amp; apos ; s been my humbling experience in this .
i &amp; apos ; m going to show you my other favorite feature .
it &amp; apos ; s like , who do i want to be ?
the teachers didn &amp; apos ; t know a switch had been made .
wouldn &amp; apos ; t we want to open doors for them instead ?
someone who didn &amp; apos ; t have a childhood is out there .
that &amp; apos ; s a key element of making that report card .
yes , you &amp; apos ; re right . let &amp; apos ; s fix it .
so if you think of the google glasses for example , then that &amp; apos ; s one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again .
it &amp; apos ; s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
at present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers .
and i &amp; apos ; d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
but he didn &amp; apos ; t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
so another one of my favorites , &amp; quot ; the starry night . &amp; quot ;
for 2050 , you &amp; apos ; ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
it &amp; apos ; s all here ; it &amp; apos ; s all on the web .
it &amp; apos ; s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
i said , &amp; quot ; well , what are you talking about ? &amp; quot ;
they don &amp; apos ; t talk about god and god &amp; apos ; s nature .
i &amp; apos ; m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
but here &amp; apos ; s what you &amp; apos ; re supposed to be thinking .
we don &amp; apos ; t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
i &amp; apos ; ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
we &amp; apos ; re more than that , we &amp; apos ; re citizens .
and this is very important , what i &amp; apos ; m going to say .
and we &amp; apos ; ve got such a long way to go with this .
i &amp; apos ; m sorry , man . am i freaking you out ?
my great ##AT##-##AT## grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
it &amp; apos ; s really old , and it &amp; apos ; s tired .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
i &amp; apos ; m an expert in relationships . &amp; quot ;
he &amp; apos ; s only deceiving you and not himself .
let &amp; apos ; s take sneakers for example , right ?
but today we &amp; apos ; re just talking about biological systems .
there &amp; apos ; s no problem with overpopulation among trees .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
yes , i &amp; apos ; m afraid of all those things .
they &amp; apos ; re all on their way back underground now .
here &amp; apos ; s this couple on the hamptons .
let &amp; apos ; s make it kogi . &amp; quot ;
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imper<<unk>> .
we don &amp; apos ; t make money at these damn shows .
and we &amp; apos ; ve seen this in cellphones .
so there &amp; apos ; s an opportunity to change that .
and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to reduce the prison population .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
boston doesn &amp; apos ; t just have a call center .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
then it &amp; apos ; s about combining the different photographs .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about wine .
what &amp; apos ; s the feed conversion ratio ? &amp; quot ;
that &amp; apos ; s great , then we have a business model .
because we can &amp; apos ; t live our lives without this lie .
let &amp; apos ; s make a short provisional appraisal .
now he &amp; apos ; s brought a tractor into the scene .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
and that wasn &amp; apos ; t a difficult diagnosis to make .
and it &amp; apos ; s very important for research in medicine .
and there &amp; apos ; s a very good reason for that .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to talk about anything .
because it doesn &amp; apos ; t feel like real money .
i mean , nobody &amp; apos ; s ever seen a particle .
and it &amp; apos ; s not just in terms of sex .
so lots of levels of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &amp; apos ; t .
it &amp; apos ; s a debate about words , about metaphors .
we didn &amp; apos ; t have polio in this country yesterday .
but you know what you &amp; apos ; re not entitled to ?
let &amp; apos ; s pretend right here we have a machine .
that means something built in a city .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
what ? that really flipped me out .
and let me begin with one example .
maybe we can see it as change .
raise your hands . let me see .
how many would opt for memory ?
i wanted to restore health from disease .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
so just imagine that for a moment .
second half . end of normal time .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
the fl<<unk>> gos eat the shrimp .
just spread it as wide as possible .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
save those . kill off the rest .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
this is alfred gonzalez .
let me show you how they work .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
there are some that are much more spatial .
their problem is that they have too little .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
my mother phoned minutes later .
i can claim anything .
i can claim anything .
pattern recognition should also work .
there are also technical cycles .
france scores . italy scores .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
so what are archaic models ?
so give me a hand here .
remember those nappies again ?
and that generally looks like this .
now , that blew my mind .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
we asked around and nobody knew .
and we built an ipad application .
and the problem is not technology itself .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
repower america . find out more .
new investments to create high ##AT##-##AT## paying jobs .
and the list can go on forever .
and in this mind they had memory .
now you see the <<unk>> matian .
protect the environment , consume less energy .
can you play it in blue now ?
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
and let me show you a simple example .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
and to report back to my attending .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
but those are all the roads in the u.s .
these are pictures over about a six ##AT##-##AT## second period .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
in any case , you imagine it happening inside .
each society is characterised by one primary medium .
china can make up for that in one second .
and , being young , i said , expectation .
his personal impressions of the waterlilies .
because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
all right , what is brand gerry ?
i &amp; apos ; m a lawyer brand .
which is great , because we need that .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
the last two mentioned are also present today .
information is every difference that makes a difference .
you put a box like this over there .
our objective was to simply say , okay ,
and in that time you can react differently .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
how are you going to feed the world ?
the shrimp eat the phytoplan<<unk>> .
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
there seems to be a discrepancy .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
because they have special skills of facilitation .
well , i think number one is curiosity .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know the protocols .
they &amp; apos ; re all important choices . &amp; quot ;
there &amp; apos ; s one more part to the story .
this would be someone who &amp; apos ; s entirely intuitive .
and that &amp; apos ; s a multi ##AT##-##AT## million dollar corporation .
i no longer want to postpone anything in life .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
what are you going to do with it ? &amp; quot ;
i want to show you something here for the first time .
they &amp; apos ; re in the back of our body .
we &amp; apos ; ll come back to these people later .
but play &amp; apos ; s a shape<<unk>> ter .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
we &amp; apos ; re right at that point of transition .
it can know how we &amp; apos ; re holding it .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
we &amp; apos ; re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
it &amp; apos ; s just taught me very simple things .
it &amp; apos ; s a question of freedom against control .
but we &amp; apos ; re beginning to see a sea change .
i &amp; apos ; ll try to do that using an example .
you &amp; apos ; ll remember the rule of three from school .
i can say , the german chancellor is a man .
it &amp; apos ; s great , but i was in love .
instead , let &amp; apos ; s look to the ecological model .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
it &amp; apos ; s cruel to millions of people .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
would you like to be more attractive and self ##AT##-##AT## confident ?
have a look what she &amp; apos ; s doing .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
no , that &amp; apos ; s what i thought .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
that &amp; apos ; s the system that we have .
i &amp; apos ; m human . i make mistakes .
so you don &amp; apos ; t lose abundant animals .
this old man &amp; apos ; s grandfather refused to go .
it &amp; apos ; s a small virus that kills bacteria .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
the fact is , coal isn &amp; apos ; t dirty .
now let &amp; apos ; s take that a step further .
no , no , that &amp; apos ; s way off .
there &amp; apos ; s never been a time like this .
and you know what ? you &amp; apos ; re wrong .
we don &amp; apos ; t want companies owning seeds .
we &amp; apos ; re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
so it &amp; apos ; s got cute little game dynamics on it .
i &amp; apos ; ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
it &amp; apos ; s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t slow for any of our grand challenges .
that &amp; apos ; s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
she &amp; apos ; s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
so , we &amp; apos ; ve always been trying to ask big questions .
it just didn &amp; apos ; t come up like that , you know ?
this is about virtuality , about non ##AT##-##AT## linearity , about storytelling .
in two hours it &amp; apos ; s biodegraded , wherever it is .
the first theorem is , klaus claims there is no soul .
and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep ##AT##-##AT## ocean exploration .
it &amp; apos ; s got one knob , on / off .
and up until now , it &amp; apos ; s been a supercomputer problem .
it &amp; apos ; s going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
and it &amp; apos ; s a great thing for this number to go up .
the last three of the five , i &amp; apos ; ve grouped together .
and i &amp; apos ; m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
and i &amp; apos ; m going to break it down for you for just a second .
i said , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m going to listen . &amp; quot ;
and , what &amp; apos ; s more , you &amp; apos ; ll now always see it .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &amp; apos ; s on .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; thank you .
it &amp; apos ; s law , it &amp; apos ; s morality , it &amp; apos ; s patent stuff .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
you hope you don &amp; apos ; t need to do that .
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
how &amp; apos ; s that look out there ? pretty good .
i don &amp; apos ; t get that feedback in real life .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
so , it &amp; apos ; s not just about the words .
and we &amp; apos ; re not exactly sure why that happens .
but i &amp; apos ; m going to focus on the demo .
now who &amp; apos ; s ready to go on this trip .
today i &amp; apos ; m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i said , &amp; quot ; okay , mama . &amp; quot ;
i said , &amp; quot ; okay , mama . &amp; quot ;
but i didn &amp; apos ; t let that daunt me .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
it &amp; apos ; s all bound by oxygen and <<unk>> ates .
so you can &amp; apos ; t put them the wrong way .
so let &amp; apos ; s pull up , now , something else .
but i &amp; apos ; ll come back to that in a moment .
in the beginning there was the tribal society , characterised by language .
this is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us .
i have to say , i don &amp; apos ; t understand it .
thank you . i &amp; apos ; ve got a question for you .
gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
that &amp; apos ; s just a working title , by the way .
we &amp; apos ; ve got to put that bear in a cage .
you have a model that emerges of the entire earth .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
if it stopped twitching , you bury them .
but we know very little about where things go .
and if not , stuxnet does nothing .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
this hit me when i went to replace my jeans .
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
so don &amp; apos ; t worry about climate change .
the same thing that i just described is now happening .
one a baby needs about six ##AT##-##AT## thousand nappies .
in reality the notes are very vague and imprecise .
the music instrument is an extension of our own body .
it will lose half of its value in one year .
and that &amp; apos ; s kind of the message .
&amp; quot ; best in the business . &amp; quot ;
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
so i can step back , and expand on that .
the first is that we will not evolve .
we no longer produce .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
and his answer was yes .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
she had irreversible brain damage .
so go ahead and start inventing .
and of course how design affects perception .
so please listen when music is played .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and the third area speaks for itself really .
so you could feel good about selling it .
they did it by draining the land .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
play is the glue that binds us together .
but what this image represents was the problem .
i &amp; apos ; m the pet guy .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
you will notice that a change has taken place .
that &amp; apos ; s where he signed up .
and in berlin there was this crazy engineering collective .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
by the end of march the lhc will be intact again .
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
hey , puma , do you are you really serious ?
i will never again play as i did in this moment .
that would be the very beginning of their own musical expression .
and anyway , you work a lot less than i do .
and then we tried out a whole load of simulations .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
&amp; quot ; sustainable proteins , &amp; quot ; he said .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
and this is a bit hard to justify i think .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
so , i say : let the world ##AT##-##AT## changing games begin .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
we &amp; apos ; ve got some places we can go .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
it &amp; apos ; s just really about combining different realities .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
we dance in the temple and become god . &amp; quot ;
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
if you have something to give , give it now .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
so they go around and do art installations like this .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
i &amp; apos ; m here to share my photography .
now it turns out you &amp; apos ; re right .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
i love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
the next one : this was the best day ever .
this is the real cool part . it &amp; apos ; s called collections .
so what i &amp; apos ; m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
i &amp; apos ; ve got it here on my laptop . &amp; quot ;
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &amp; apos ; t you .
but at the same time , we know it can &amp; apos ; t .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to end mass incarceration . &amp; quot ;
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
and i saw mrs. drucker , and she was <<unk>> less .
it &amp; apos ; s creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
it &amp; apos ; s the time it takes to fall in love with someone .
if , in fact , we couldn &amp; apos ; t absorb and release phosphorus .
it &amp; apos ; s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
but for a lot people , that &amp; apos ; s a bit too radical .
i &amp; apos ; m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &amp; apos ; t .
they need it , and we &amp; apos ; re not giving it to them .
we don &amp; apos ; t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
this is moore &amp; apos ; s law over the last hundred years .
these devices aren &amp; apos ; t accessible to people . &amp; quot ;
it is natanz , and it is only natanz .
so we &amp; apos ; ll offer one of these fabulous scents .
what &amp; apos ; s the next one you want to talk about ?
and i think there &amp; apos ; s almost a paradox with those .
that &amp; apos ; s only online -- no print , no tv .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
because that &amp; apos ; s where the real work of government happens .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
so we don &amp; apos ; t have the budgets that other brands have .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to get to the point of automation .
i don &amp; apos ; t know if any of you know this image .
can &amp; apos ; t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
thirty ##AT##-##AT## nine inches is the tallest structure i &amp; apos ; ve seen .
i thought , let &amp; apos ; s up the ante , once .
it &amp; apos ; s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
but you can &amp; apos ; t count my fingers right now can you ?
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
i &amp; apos ; ll do it for you , and then i &amp; apos ; ll explain it .
you &amp; apos ; ve got to admit that &amp; apos ; s a lot of choice .
i won &amp; apos ; t be able to play like i do today in twenty years .
you &amp; apos ; re doing something that &amp; apos ; s actually a little bit different .
and he &amp; apos ; s an economist . so , he &amp; apos ; s rational .
it &amp; apos ; s not perfect , but it &amp; apos ; s a lot better .
i think even if you kill someone , you &amp; apos ; re not just a killer .
and if i can , i &amp; apos ; ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
i &amp; apos ; ll be revealing what &amp; apos ; s inside of it in a moment .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &amp; apos ; re using games today .
he said , &amp; quot ; we don &amp; apos ; t have the death penalty in germany .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
but we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed .
secondly , if he &amp; apos ; s right , then he doesn &amp; apos ; t have a soul .
i &amp; apos ; m going to show you one example of what i &amp; apos ; m talking about .
so that &amp; apos ; s why we &amp; apos ; re not talking about resource efficiency , but <<unk>> tivity .
this is &amp; quot ; the starry night , &amp; quot ; i think , never seen like this before .
and i &amp; apos ; d say , &amp; quot ; yes , ma &amp; apos ; am , i do . &amp; quot ;
you do this and then you &amp; apos ; ll see the sentence , although i &amp; apos ; m with the fire brigade , i &amp; apos ; m interested in pyrotechnical things .
that &amp; apos ; s not supposed to be a joke , but here in the image below you can see there &amp; apos ; s the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there . i &amp; apos ; d like to briefly mention a project .
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
the main problem we have here , it &amp; apos ; s kind of like aids .
now we &amp; apos ; re a long way away from that goal right now .
there &amp; apos ; s designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
and yet , we don &amp; apos ; t quite understand the options of it .
maybe i didn &amp; apos ; t want to be a high ##AT##-##AT## maintenance resident .
and he was here , as you well know , in &amp; apos ; 35 .
we &amp; apos ; re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
that &amp; apos ; s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is greenland .
you &amp; apos ; ll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
it &amp; apos ; s more than that ; it &amp; apos ; s deeper .
that &amp; apos ; s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
that &amp; apos ; s the problem that i &amp; apos ; m trying to solve .
and that &amp; apos ; s what happened at the end of that three ##AT##-##AT## month period .
so we &amp; apos ; re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
since that time , we &amp; apos ; ve had all kinds of acknowledgment .
i didn &amp; apos ; t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &amp; apos ; ve had ?
it doesn &amp; apos ; t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
good , really good , maybe an all ##AT##-##AT## star .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
it would be so energizing and so empowering .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
but combined , they can create something like this .
i made the decision to move to the u.s .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
we would never do that in our own countries .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
how much money does it take to do this ?
i filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
i learned that it all changes in an instant .
the dog ! i was stunned with jeal<<unk>> .
evolution does not necessarily favor the <<unk>> st ##AT##-##AT## lived .
this is another look at the tree of life .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
here are two patients , those are their recordings .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
that really is very important , that we get there .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
&amp; quot ; yes , &amp; quot ; he said .
&amp; quot ; absolutely , &amp; quot ; i said .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
of course this lends itself to a smart grid .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
because this person is not interested in evidence at all .
so we can &amp; apos ; t bear these things .
because the notes are the only direct connection to him .
he only lived until the age of thirty ##AT##-##AT## nine .
the whole thing is a game , i must add .
how many doors does the house you live in have ?
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
the answer is &amp; quot ; no . &amp; quot ;
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
yes , so , what is biohacking ?
now , chimpanzees are well ##AT##-##AT## known for their aggression .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
the second factor is the services we use .
and i talked them into funding an expedition .
that it comes to the human from outside .
we can see that phosphorus is really critical .
that means the rate of crime goes down .
so how do humans deal with certain objects .
we can take a look at that now .
what happened is the the so ##AT##-##AT## called machine age .
the only thing they had was their mind .
so we start with a windows dropper .
so to him , they were just blocks .
go bother leonard cohen . &amp; quot ;
well i went into the courtroom .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
it could happen in learning time scales .
here are the results we just obtained .
amanda is wearing our elegs set .
imagine then just two other little changes .
how about living longer with good health ?
the marshmallow has to be on top .
we went back to the titanic wreck .
well diginotar is a c.a .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
but perhaps someone just needs to change your mind .
to maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer .
that &amp; apos ; s what the norm says .
just like it used to happen in the village .
however there is a political battle in our country .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
see , dr. kean made that shift in thinking .
they put her on a ventilator .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
they had 348 different kinds of jam .
here , let me give you an analogy .
you zoom in . you really go in .
you look around at all these museums here .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
think about this : this attack is generic .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
and they didn &amp; apos ; t have photolithography .
... a little more about you that is not who you are .
that &amp; apos ; s the consequence that we have to face .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
we don &amp; apos ; t want iran to get the bomb .
it &amp; apos ; s when italy won the soccer world cup .
you &amp; apos ; re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
and then i &amp; apos ; ll explain why i explained it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
think about that , it &amp; apos ; s an incredible fact .
and yes , i &amp; apos ; ll move on a slide .
to form a phrase with one &amp; apos ; s own breath .
the first question is , are there really too many of us ?
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
so here &amp; apos ; s another few people trying it out .
but that &amp; apos ; s the sound of clean coal technology .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
we &amp; apos ; re focusing on now fourth ##AT##-##AT## generation fuels .
but settling isn &amp; apos ; t always such a bad thing .
and we get to re ##AT##-##AT## invent ourselves as often as we like .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
and it &amp; apos ; s also deeply embedded in our lives .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
there &amp; apos ; s an economist named edward castronova .
they wouldn &amp; apos ; t starve , and you know what ?
so let &amp; apos ; s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
i mean , you &amp; apos ; ve never seen anything like this .
he &amp; apos ; s a biologist at veta la palma .
the question is , why don &amp; apos ; t they have more ?
then i would say , my warm condolences , you see ?
of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all .
clean coal -- you &amp; apos ; ve heard a lot about it .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &amp; quot ;
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the ethnosphere is humanity &amp; apos ; s great legacy .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
so he &amp; apos ; s getting citizens to check on them .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
we &amp; apos ; ve all got navigation controls in our car .
when i say realism , i mean photo ##AT##-##AT## realism .
i told my mother i couldn &amp; apos ; t do it .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
i can &amp; apos ; t , but this guy can .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
it is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise .
and how do we function , when we look in there ?
you are virtualising the reality without a computer .
yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ?
like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
he invited over to dinner the king of siam .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
zidane , the headbutt in a moment .
i &amp; apos ; ve got something to show you .
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
but will we make the most of our playfulness ?
in other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
we have the capital of the techno ##AT##-##AT## philanthropist .
it &amp; apos ; s a game called foldit .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
yeah , bryan , the judge has some magic power .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
he smiled and said , oh ?
it was summertime : i had shorts on .
here &amp; apos ; s the updated version of this entry .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
... these dosages have something to do with it .
there wasn &amp; apos ; t any cantaloupe .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
we negotiated with investors , i looked for new shareholders .
and she asked him , so what are your hobbies ?
then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ?
so it &amp; apos ; s about <<unk>> tivity , not efficiency .
and as we get older , the nappies get bigger .
yes , i &amp; apos ; m very happy to be here .
that means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm .
i know of some people who haven &amp; apos ; t registered .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
then , in my opinion , a really good code was created .
it &amp; apos ; s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i want to say just a word about salad dressing .
a few years ago i started developing littlebits .
&amp; quot ; a pale blue dot . &amp; quot ;
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . &amp; quot ;
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
it &amp; apos ; s about the nuance of human language .
recession . default . doomsday . egypt . syria .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
&amp; quot ; you have not let it go . &amp; quot ;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .
a playful , mindful brand . what is your brand ?
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
emc presents : &amp; quot ; embrace transparency . &amp; quot ;
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i say we are ready for our own epic game .
the brochures still say it is untouched .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
as the one hat , i do history of anatomy .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
i was there not long ago with miguel .
an anecdote you might know talks about this time .
why do i have to get such a small car ?
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
but our perception , how it deceives us too .
they live lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
and this is a syndrome called and<<unk>> insensitivity syndrome .
we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
i want to achieve it through not dying . &amp; quot ;
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
and the answer is really straightforward : they are lost forever .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
that &amp; apos ; s fantastic . i love big placebo .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
so you see what enormous potential for speed there is here .
smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere .
i play to explain what these tones might have meant .
and sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
and other another example are the ambient , intelligent systems .
and today we are still very , very dependent on stories .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
so that &amp; apos ; s <<unk>> pythesec movement has done .
this second fish , it &amp; apos ; s a different kind of love story .
and it &amp; apos ; s the first question to ask is what is right .
the less i think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is .
most of us know most people have heard of this in the context of software .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
and what i got was good , but it wasn &amp; apos ; t perfect .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
and in fact , we &amp; apos ; re such a multi ##AT##-##AT## cellular community .
&amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s success , &amp; quot ; he said .
but it &amp; apos ; s doing something that no other government technology does .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
but it didn &amp; apos ; t sit well with my logical side either .
so all of the green areas , these are your target ##AT##-##AT## rich environments .
that &amp; apos ; s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
if we fix cities , actually it &amp; apos ; s a big deal .
i brought seven pairs of underpants and that &amp; apos ; s it .
so i &amp; apos ; m going to show you exactly what i brought .
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real ##AT##-##AT## world work ?
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
this is one of the most painful <<unk>> liations to make in a creative life .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments .
that &amp; apos ; s literally covering just like a two and a half ##AT##-##AT## week period .
please , don &amp; apos ; t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
it &amp; apos ; s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &amp; apos ; s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &amp; quot ;
so , i was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
there was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in bach &amp; apos ; s time .
here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs .
i &amp; apos ; d like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
i &amp; apos ; m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
and if you don &amp; apos ; t , someone can steal it from you .
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
it &amp; apos ; s called &amp; quot ; talk to me . &amp; quot ;
now in practice they don &amp; apos ; t actually test people for their chromosomes .
only i think that he &amp; apos ; s rather loving it here , right ?
turns out though , that that &amp; apos ; s not even where it stops .
but then i thought , you know , let &amp; apos ; s be honest .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the atlantic .
and when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
that &amp; apos ; s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
the first of these traps is a <<unk>> <<unk>> to admit complexity .
and we shouldn &amp; apos ; t : our health care system sucks .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no .
he said , &amp; quot ; the skin acts like a sponge .
that the human descended from apes and we have a shared ancestor .
and also anything they would conjure up in their minds today .
when you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground .
there &amp; apos ; s already a rather impressive number of people worldwide .
repower america . it &amp; apos ; s time to get real .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
if your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
we take the pictures of those mini ##AT##-##AT## big bangs inside detectors .
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what about polio ? let &amp; apos ; s have that . why not ?
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &amp; apos ; t give me .
this tool that i &amp; apos ; m using here is a little experiment .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &amp; apos ; t feed its animals ?
naturally it &amp; apos ; s from asia , in this case from japan .
the annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language .
that means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful .
here here it &amp; apos ; s more likely to turn into my glasses .
before this , we were in the so ##AT##-##AT## called age of feudalism .
and the predictions , as you &amp; apos ; ve read , are serious .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e ##AT##-##AT## book .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of diginotar .
well because they don &amp; apos ; t know that it was different .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there &amp; apos ; s nanotechnology coming on , nanomaterials .
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
because we don &amp; apos ; t just enjoy now , we participate .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
and they did this using so ##AT##-##AT## called lead maps .
the official dogma of all western industrial societies .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
you know , you can choose your list .
have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ?
and i think it makes the world look like this .
well there are opportunities all around us .
so , this is world without oil .
you can throw it anywhere you want .
and how does it look in there ?
and issue rogue <<unk>> ates .
i call it the rising billion .
these things are logically correct .
a all the beautiful things in life are inefficient .
and they are just the biohackers , individuals .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
ok , think of this as extreme self ##AT##-##AT## motivation .
i know what people think when they see this .
not a movie , not <<unk>> -- for real .
you collect information about the piece in secondary literature .
things that are only used go into technical systems .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
i &amp; apos ; m just showing the new york times website here .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
there weren &amp; apos ; t christmas trees . we made it all .
it &amp; apos ; s just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
i &amp; apos ; m jessi , and this is my suitcase .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
but in my humanity , i also allow my ego to get in .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &amp; quot ;
i sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
but it wasn &amp; apos ; t like that in the eighties .
no , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ?
so it &amp; apos ; s always interesting to know as a designer .
those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
we think it &amp; apos ; s clean -- smells good , too .
and &amp; quot ; <<unk>> ! &amp; quot ; to you , nonetheless .
second , what economists call &amp; quot ; opportunity costs . &amp; quot ;
they &amp; apos ; re in the united states and europe and in japan .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
so let &amp; apos ; s project this analogy going forward .
now you don &amp; apos ; t find several thousand targets in that area .
they never give you a challenge that you can &amp; apos ; t achieve .
that &amp; apos ; s my flesh , and i can twist that around .
cassava &amp; apos ; s something that half a billion people eat .
it &amp; apos ; s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
or b , because you didn &amp; apos ; t learn how to sing ?
that &amp; apos ; s why we need to think from cradle to cradle .
in 25 years it &amp; apos ; s gone from this , to this .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &amp; apos ; s humanity .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
it &amp; apos ; s just a quick video of what we do .
but what &amp; apos ; s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
like i said , it all just started in two thousand eight .
you end up in thabo mbeki south africa .
there &amp; apos ; s step ##AT##-##AT## by ##AT##-##AT## step instructions on this .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
it &amp; apos ; s that acrid , tar ##AT##-##AT## like flavor .
they have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment .
there &amp; apos ; s the a direct returning system for this .
that &amp; apos ; s a funny occurrence , you know .
everything that &amp; apos ; s nice in life is not efficient .
and oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources .
and then it &amp; apos ; s less usable or user friendly .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
i think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so .
if you want to go far , go together . &amp; quot ;
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c.a .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
jeopardy &amp; apos ; s not an easy game .
56 percent of all rape cases don &amp; apos ; t result .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
we &amp; apos ; re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
it &amp; apos ; s unpredictable -- like this odd country road .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
so i wear two hats in most of what i do .
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
i mean i &amp; apos ; ve rarely seen lines so flat .
there &amp; apos ; s just no way of getting it right .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
a piece of music that is interpreted for the umpteenth time is comparable in this way .
we no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but <<unk>> fy them through language .
i &amp; apos ; m going to keep writing anyway because that &amp; apos ; s my job .
and i don &amp; apos ; t expect that that &amp; apos ; s ever going to change .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
i &amp; apos ; m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
it &amp; apos ; s not even an idea ; it &amp; apos ; s a process .
you know , there weren &amp; apos ; t tangerines in the garden of eden .
the fact is it &amp; apos ; s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
there &amp; apos ; s no other way to describe what &amp; apos ; s going on here .
and , right away , i see there &amp; apos ; s a different pattern that emerges .
that &amp; apos ; s not a business , and it isn &amp; apos ; t agriculture .
now , he &amp; apos ; s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplan<<unk>> .
and if i &amp; apos ; m right , then the chancellor is a man .
i &amp; apos ; m aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
in holland we &amp; apos ; ve been working on this for over three years now .
and that &amp; apos ; s what &amp; apos ; s there , and comes back again .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
we can &amp; apos ; t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don &amp; apos ; t need at all .
and we &amp; apos ; ve accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non ##AT##-##AT## linearity .
and that &amp; apos ; s this piece of metal i &amp; apos ; m going to be talking about in a minute .
i &amp; apos ; m not a robot ; i don &amp; apos ; t do things the same way each time .
there &amp; apos ; s a lot of other stuff here , but i don &amp; apos ; t have time .
i &amp; apos ; m not good enough , and i can &amp; apos ; t do it . &amp; quot ;
that &amp; apos ; s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
and i didn &amp; apos ; t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
so there &amp; apos ; s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .
and that &amp; apos ; s the truth . now , the studio didn &amp; apos ; t know that .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &amp; apos ; ll end with this story .
you &amp; apos ; re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
yeah , i don &amp; apos ; t know what &amp; apos ; s going to come of this .
i don &amp; apos ; t know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
we &amp; apos ; re making and<<unk>> , and we &amp; apos ; re responding to androgens .
it &amp; apos ; s not impossible , but it &amp; apos ; s not a very easy thing .
he said , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m so proud of you . &amp; quot ;
and so the next stage that &amp; apos ; s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and that &amp; apos ; s basically what i &amp; apos ; m going to be talking about .
you &amp; apos ; ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
the ground stores over sixty percent of the planet &amp; apos ; s carbon .
i didn &amp; apos ; t know how to use the cutlery .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub ##AT##-##AT## choices of course .
so what we &amp; apos ; re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and for example , this would be somebody who &amp; apos ; s completely logical .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
here &amp; apos ; s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
because they &amp; apos ; re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
so , i &amp; apos ; ve known a lot of fish in my life .
and then it comes to me straight away , it &amp; apos ; s unfair .
because we don &amp; apos ; t we no longer make things free of stuff .
and the more <<unk>> dly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
why do they market to us if we can &amp; apos ; t buy them ?
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and it &amp; apos ; s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
but they don &amp; apos ; t perceive what happened before as a loss .
we transform the world , but we don &amp; apos ; t remember it .
and that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
what &amp; apos ; s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
as you can see , these images aren &amp; apos ; t really special .
we &amp; apos ; ve also been taking littlebits to design schools .
i said , &amp; quot ; well we &amp; apos ; re trying to challenge injustice .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &amp; quot ;
i don &amp; apos ; t see any reason why it shouldn &amp; apos ; t .
you &amp; apos ; re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
i hope you &amp; apos ; re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
i mean , let &amp; apos ; s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
that &amp; apos ; s a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
but of course it &amp; apos ; s the sum of a whole load of ideas .
i can &amp; apos ; t say whether it &amp; apos ; s good or bad .
in my warped little industry , that &amp; apos ; s my brand .
and what we caught , we didn &amp; apos ; t have words for it .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
and i think that &amp; apos ; s the orientation that we have to change .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
it &amp; apos ; s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
and i don &amp; apos ; t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
but it &amp; apos ; s also a great example of government as a platform .
and that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
this is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s .
she saved my life ; i and my partner saved hers .
we went to san paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
it was a store called draeger &amp; apos ; s .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
you rented your phone . you didn &amp; apos ; t buy it .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
i wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly .
and to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ?
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
failed writer ##AT##-##AT## <<unk>> lic brand .
looks pretty much like old ##AT##-##AT## style assembly language .
this is a highly useless categorization scheme .
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
he &amp; apos ; s interested in setting fires .
it does not have a tangible , material nature .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
those would just be the letters you learned to write .
logic does not make any statement about what is valid .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
when you look at the people you deal with ..
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and i started to think i should just dump this project .
repower america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not .
and when i say the word justice , this feeling disappears .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
well , they couldn &amp; apos ; t make it work , not economically .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
he had a potentially life ##AT##-##AT## threatening condition called epiglottitis .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function .
on the contrary , it &amp; apos ; s a complex metaphysical worldview .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the sierra snowpack .
and that &amp; apos ; s the projection of seeing , feedback , seeing .
you can only have zero emissions if you don &amp; apos ; t exist .
the composer increasingly becomes like a friend you &amp; apos ; re living with .
there &amp; apos ; s the opec , a a bunch of amateurs .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
now , i thought , &amp; quot ; how could i really capture this ?
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
so how do we operationalize the question of content of character ?
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
and this piece of 50 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old technology became the most magical thing to me .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
and what i &amp; apos ; ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
with the agriculture we practice in brazil in which we win back nutrients .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
i &amp; apos ; m surprised that people often forget something very elementary .
and then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
no fear , no agony . polio -- puff , gone .
we are effectively grading someone &amp; apos ; s worth to our community .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo .
this is called the eyewriter , and you can see the description .
you create like a water curtain with pixels made of water .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
and over 10,000 aeds already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
he says , &amp; quot ; brace for impact . &amp; quot ;
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
why ? because we don &amp; apos ; t have polio . and you know what ?
and i say , &amp; quot ; don &amp; apos ; t put limitations on yourself .
because it doesn &amp; apos ; t know which haystack it should go to first .
we can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ?
future &amp; apos ; s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
an extraordinary statement to make about your life &amp; apos ; s work , you know .
on the 10th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
you &amp; apos ; ve seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
and he described one of them as very &amp; quot ; common . &amp; quot ;
and when i listened to her , she was making a wheezy sound .
and i did well , i graduated with honors , cum laude .
i &amp; apos ; m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
and so we &amp; apos ; re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 1840 &amp; apos ; s .
and it &amp; apos ; s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
we use our vocal chords to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance .
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
she wasn &amp; apos ; t going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way .
that &amp; apos ; s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
and i had to explain to the journalists there isn &amp; apos ; t such a test .
but there &amp; apos ; s a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening .
if we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non ##AT##-##AT## image data .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
&amp; quot ; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
you learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes .
&amp; quot ; great , &amp; quot ; i said . got off the phone .
the system is so healthy , it &amp; apos ; s totally self ##AT##-##AT## renewing .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
but if you ask me today , i &amp; apos ; m not so sure .
that &amp; apos ; s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and as a general term , we can use the term intersex for this .
and so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone .
it &amp; apos ; s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
and now we &amp; apos ; ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
i &amp; apos ; ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
but that being said , it &amp; apos ; s a very good media opportunity .
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
how well do you think you &amp; apos ; re doing at managing those choices ?
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you &amp; apos ; re not ?
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
and then here &amp; apos ; s a really , really big close ##AT##-##AT## up of the little piece of metal .
there &amp; apos ; s a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
probably the best part of it is what &amp; apos ; s coming down the pike in health .
and , although it &amp; apos ; s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
and , needless to say , thank god i wasn &amp; apos ; t using a thesaurus back then .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &amp; apos ; s room .
this is an amazing device , but it &amp; apos ; s the equivalent of an etch a sketch .
now don &amp; apos ; t get me wrong here , it didn &amp; apos ; t go like this .
that &amp; apos ; s not being politically active , that &amp; apos ; s being bureaucratically active .
and that &amp; apos ; s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
it &amp; apos ; s the kind of complicated circle that i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you about .
so this image , for example , has close to , i think , around 10 billion pixels .
the consequence of this is that we &amp; apos ; ve unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise .
and these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clashing with each other at the moment .
and i &amp; apos ; d really love to show you my week &amp; apos ; s worth of outfits right now .
she said , &amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &amp; quot ;
the second theorem is thus , if klaus is right , then he doesn &amp; apos ; t have a soul .
the r &amp; amp ; amp ; d piece , it &amp; apos ; s crazy how little it &amp; apos ; s funded .
and here i &amp; apos ; ll zoom in a little bit . we &amp; apos ; re looking right there in the center .
so i &amp; apos ; m actually just going to go in and launch khoya , an interactive app for the ipad .
so we don &amp; apos ; t have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible .
and a lot of them , you &amp; apos ; ll look at and say , &amp; quot ; they &amp; apos ; re crazy . &amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s good .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
a work of art that is never looked at will never gather the strength to have an effect .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .
you &amp; apos ; ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
now i didn &amp; apos ; t know very much about government when i started this program .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &amp; apos ; t seen .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &amp; apos ; re not just a <<unk>> .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
and that &amp; apos ; s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
this young man &amp; apos ; s father had been ascribed to the panchen lama .
i &amp; apos ; ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
on our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better .
that &amp; apos ; s high ##AT##-##AT## tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves .
tempt &amp; apos ; s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
let &amp; apos ; s call him miguel -- actually his name is miguel .
he said , &amp; quot ; fish ? i didn &amp; apos ; t know anything about fish .
so , that &amp; apos ; s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &amp; apos ; s knuckles .
i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
but at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
you want button fly or zipper fly ? you want stonewashed or acid ##AT##-##AT## washed ?
that &amp; apos ; s the one that relies on two billion years of on ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## job experience .
i mean , you &amp; apos ; re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
anybody who &amp; apos ; s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
a crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
because music is a language and music is there to communicate something .
whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste .
today , it has many employees and they can all get involved .
it &amp; apos ; s about making a beneficial poop print .
because they changed their chairman of the board of directors twice now .
there are still six hundred billion trees in the amazon forest alone .
that goes back a lot further , to the pre ##AT##-##AT## industrial cultures .
i &amp; apos ; m going to go ahead and select government .
so the device you see here didn &amp; apos ; t work .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
at the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
what about contributions we can &amp; apos ; t even predict ?
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
say , &amp; quot ; please repeat that process . &amp; quot ;
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
but where would be the nearest aed to help this patient ?
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
words , for so long his friends , now <<unk>> ked him .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
the responses mostly will be &amp; quot ; no . &amp; quot ;
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
a friend of mine did that -- richard bollingbroke .
you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharma .
so that was a very successful hack in my opinion .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
there are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
&amp; quot ; look at their bellies , pink .
and then we started negotiating with the islanders .
you no longer need to whistle or sing a song .
so how do you start speaking the language of music ?
you study works that have been composed before or after .
the next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight .
so i looked into when things are natural and intuitive .
this is an average ##AT##-##AT## size greenlandic iceberg .
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
well let me work up some blood for you .
this rule of three contains three theorems .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
tsunami warning . cyber ##AT##-##AT## attacks .
societal decay . 65 dead .
mark , mark , come back .
we talk about drowning in data .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were <<unk>> ously encouraged .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
we &amp; apos ; re using games to escape real ##AT##-##AT## world suffering .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
and these folks know something that we &amp; apos ; ve lost sight of .
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants .
so when klaus says , there is no soul .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
what has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ?
he said he didn &amp; apos ; t know . he would ask around .
and then we have to decrease our must ##AT##-##AT## run capacities in the network .
this , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation .
the loud and soft symbols , f and b , etcetera .
then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation .
interpreters are <<unk>> ators of the written notes in resounding music .
so you &amp; apos ; re helping out there , just ask the people .
but for now i &amp; apos ; ll just keep up the <<unk>> ense .
using a kind of torch , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . &amp; quot ;
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
it &amp; apos ; s an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
bryan , you &amp; apos ; ve struck a massive chord here .
and what &amp; apos ; s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
and no , this isn &amp; apos ; t burning man or san francisco .

ah , the majority . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
this is a portrait by a photographer named phil toledano .
we hate big government . we don &amp; apos ; t trust the man .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever ##AT##-##AT## growing structures .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
it &amp; apos ; s a type of territorial behavior , right ?
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
so the question is , how should we deal with nappies ?
so , for example , protect the environment , drive the car less .
and that &amp; apos ; s happened to me these last six months .
i &amp; apos ; m sorry i have to keep this so short .
the interesting thing about this is that i can make a short trip .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
you know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &amp; quot ;
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .

in many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
and this has spread just <<unk>> tionlessly , organically , naturally .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
that too , so you can get back those things in any shop .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
click and , bang , you &amp; apos ; re in this museum .

as a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path .
there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &amp; quot ;
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
so i offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
and we became a family , over a four ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## half year period .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
it &amp; apos ; s the last defense before anything enters the body .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
it &amp; apos ; s not even online . it &amp; apos ; s not even streaming .
they &amp; apos ; re always worried they &amp; apos ; re going to lose shelf space .
but now it &amp; apos ; s not on the local level , but on the global level .
a young lad like that , he &amp; apos ; s not interested in putting out fires .

it &amp; apos ; s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
so now let &amp; apos ; s just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .

but the king of siam , he was fed with aluminum utensils .
well i &amp; apos ; ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .

and yes , i &amp; apos ; ve got a challenge , as you might see .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &amp; apos ; ve got 56 choices .
and i don &amp; apos ; t mean just good as in successful , although that &amp; apos ; s part of it .
now , how we &amp; apos ; re going to go forward on this -- what &amp; apos ; s the right approach ?
and then people would be able to eat it and they &amp; apos ; d be able to not go blind .
and i &amp; apos ; m bawling , i &amp; apos ; m crying , like a little kid .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
or maybe you &amp; apos ; d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina .
so ceos , a little bit better than average , but here &amp; apos ; s where it gets interesting .

it &amp; apos ; s our new homeland . it &amp; apos ; s called nunavut .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
it &amp; apos ; s the same information . it &amp; apos ; s the same number of choices .
it &amp; apos ; s almost like we &amp; apos ; ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
remember , it &amp; apos ; s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
now i know what you &amp; apos ; re thinking , but i &amp; apos ; m no hero .
+ that is they &amp; apos ; re all in the pre ##AT##-##AT## nappy stage , so to speak .
i &amp; apos ; m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
there &amp; apos ; s some magical amount . i don &amp; apos ; t know what it is .

mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and i would love for ceg to help make it happen .
serve food at a soup kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .

so , okay , to hack into biology , you need material .
we have seven million people on probation and par<<unk>> .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
so what we did , we crowdsourced the netherlands .
evolution <<unk>> ors those creatures best adapted to their environment .

i don &amp; apos ; t want to go back , and it &amp; apos ; s not because i &amp; apos ; m adventurous .
we &amp; apos ; re accumulating our knowledge on a global level and we &amp; apos ; re accumulating it increasingly quicker and better , for example .
so now what i &amp; apos ; m going to do is i &amp; apos ; m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &amp; apos ; t belong to them , they &amp; apos ; re not just a thief .

he said , &amp; quot ; jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? &amp; quot ;
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
she said , &amp; quot ; i think you can do anything you want to do . &amp; quot ;
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &amp; apos ; s happening there .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &amp; apos ; m opening it .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blanketed with networks , electronics .
and the adrenal glands make androgens , which are a masculinizing hormone .

it didn &amp; apos ; t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &amp; apos ; s it going ?
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that &amp; apos ; s happening .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
to do that , don &amp; apos ; t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
so we don &amp; apos ; t need to be climate neutral , we can be climate ##AT##-##AT## positive .
and and you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it .
it &amp; apos ; s an open ##AT##-##AT## ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
i don &amp; apos ; t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
you can have me as a farmer , or in leathers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
the founding fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why .
they played dice games for 18 years , we &amp; apos ; ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .

not like me -- i &amp; apos ; m a game designer ; i &amp; apos ; m exuberant .
a big machine , a cool , ted ##AT##-##AT## ish machine , and it &amp; apos ; s a time machine .

the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &amp; quot ; daemons . &amp; quot ;
then of course , there &amp; apos ; s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
and it &amp; apos ; s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .

instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the wilds of city hall .
thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .

ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
on this island , that &amp; apos ; s the island graciosa on azores .
so through this mode of passing on the burden of proving something you are experiencing the brilliance of the lie .
well , so it says presto at the top , so that &amp; apos ; s a fast piece .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
twice in one emergency shift , i missed appendicitis .
you see it straight away .
now we have the third theorem .
famine in somalia . police pepper spray .
or anything that i imagine because they might have thought .

now why do we draw technology curves in semi ##AT##-##AT## log curves ?
you were you were invited to dinner , not to steal nutrients .
but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real ##AT##-##AT## time control systems .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?

at the other end of the planet , antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
then the next generation came , which is where we &amp; apos ; re still primarily at .
many people use the word but don &amp; apos ; t know what it means in detail .
so , as a designer , i design <<unk>> our much more much more often than appearance .
you can only be climate neutral if you don &amp; apos ; t exist , you see ?
we do it in china for example , where we directly take the waste produced from it .
you can also try it with words like revenge or acquisitiveness and the like .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
and if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &amp; apos ; t achieve everything ?
and they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
you know , i never thought that i &amp; apos ; d end up working at microsoft .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have geordie making ...
it &amp; apos ; s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
so it says , &amp; quot ; place your fingers upon each light . &amp; quot ;
they &amp; apos ; re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
so if you think about this practically , here &amp; apos ; s where we are .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
there is only one , and that &amp; apos ; s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
so all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
exactly one week &amp; apos ; s worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &amp; apos ; t also destroy it .
i took the liberty i asked lilly , if it would be okay to mention her .
i &amp; apos ; d now like to present to you what we found out at our institute .
so it was curiosity and i somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it .
already in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we &amp; apos ; ve never been before ?
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## use brick .
we have two beings , both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day .
threats , in the wake of bin laden &amp; apos ; s death , have spiked .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .

in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
he doesn &amp; apos ; t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
it &amp; apos ; s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
the categories need to say something to the chooser , not the choice ##AT##-##AT## maker .
and i was like , &amp; quot ; hold on . that sounds interesting . &amp; quot ;
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
friday : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequins go with everything .
i like to smile and say , &amp; quot ; thank you . &amp; quot ;
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
people are always upset when i say , &amp; quot ; cut . &amp; quot ;
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self ##AT##-##AT## interests .
we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
on february 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one .
what is the machete ? what pupa stage are you in now ?
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in 1d .
you see on the left the pixels , the different resolutions being captured .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &amp; quot ;
in a split second , i lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
i &amp; apos ; ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
it tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
the title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renewable energies .
so that what they had only con<<unk>> up in their minds becomes listenable .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
it &amp; apos ; s because of what happened in 1776 with the founding fathers .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
adversity is just change that we haven &amp; apos ; t adapted ourselves to yet .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
and that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest .
and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
the woman then complained that the portrait didn &amp; apos ; t look anything like her .
we tell people , oh well , you people in the south are not environmentally aware .
some of them are also registered together with the hackerspaces , those places .
you see the colosseum in the middle , the river tiber .
finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
and you say , &amp; quot ; doc , what should i do ? &amp; quot ;
of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
or perhaps you &amp; apos ; re one of those who &amp; apos ; s always yearned for more creativity .
so apparently humans don &amp; apos ; t like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves .
but even i , in my mulishness , even i have brushed up against that thing , at times .
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &amp; apos ; re given the right work .
you &amp; apos ; ll get to see , you can look away too if you &amp; apos ; d like to .
i &amp; apos ; m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
that &amp; apos ; s equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly .
so , you don &amp; apos ; t abstain from food just because you can &amp; apos ; t cook .
you can explain this much more <<unk>> ately later on , as there &amp; apos ; s more much more to this .
you can put a knob in between and now you &amp; apos ; ve made a little dimmer .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality .
a tv or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don &amp; apos ; t expend them .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it &amp; apos ; s a great thing .
we were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the organisation .
that means there are not too many of us , we &amp; apos ; re just too stupid , you see ?
when they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should &amp; apos ; ve been perfect .
you really want to get the decision right if it &amp; apos ; s for all eternity , right ?
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &amp; apos ; s about increased incarceration rates .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
when i was a child , i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &amp; apos ; t quite even understand .
but really what they &amp; apos ; re doing is they &amp; apos ; re showing what &amp; apos ; s possible with technology today .
and when you are with people who are firmly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an in<<unk>> real framework around you , and it &amp; apos ; s not material , and you are just made of flesh and blood , are solid , so to speak , bound to the earth , ephemeral , subject to decay , insignificant , dead really .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real <<unk>> scene <<unk>> , and we &amp; apos ; re online , and we we know the people who are always chatting there and everything .
i said , &amp; quot ; no , i don &amp; apos ; t feel right about that . y &amp; apos ; all go ahead . y &amp; apos ; all go ahead . &amp; quot ;
and it &amp; apos ; s not because they &amp; apos ; re less smart , and it &amp; apos ; s not because they &amp; apos ; re less diligent .
and if you think of this condition , then you &amp; apos ; ll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie .
we all know what &amp; apos ; s good about it , so i &amp; apos ; m going to talk about what &amp; apos ; s bad about it .
and also , even though it &amp; apos ; s plotted on a log curve on the left , it &amp; apos ; s curving upwards .
so you don &amp; apos ; t need to abstain from listening to classical music because you don &amp; apos ; t play an instrument .
it would be un<<unk>> onable for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s true , we &amp; apos ; ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &amp; apos ; t science .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &amp; apos ; s access .
when i say , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m operating it , &amp; quot ; but my mind is in the vehicle .
and what that &amp; apos ; s going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they &amp; apos ; re good results .
he said , &amp; quot ; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &amp; apos ; re special . &amp; quot ;
he was just a toddler and he wasn &amp; apos ; t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
it &amp; apos ; s the finite resource that we &amp; apos ; re spending while we &amp; apos ; re on this earth .
and then she said , &amp; quot ; i just need you to promise me three things , bryan . &amp; quot ;
so we &amp; apos ; re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
it &amp; apos ; s because possibilities on this planet , they don &amp; apos ; t go back , they go forward .
so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &amp; apos ; s a little bit crazy .
really , you &amp; apos ; d have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will .
which of course very much accommodates for storytelling , and it &amp; apos ; s a computer game .
so , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
and , because you &amp; apos ; re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
if you &amp; apos ; re counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
so what we &amp; apos ; re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
&amp; quot ; well , it &amp; apos ; s about 30 percent , &amp; quot ; he said .
and then he added , &amp; quot ; we &amp; apos ; re basically a world unto ourselves .
we can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network .
i &amp; apos ; ve brought along a project i &amp; apos ; d like to introduce to you .
and she said i should perhaps present my island project , which i will try to present to you .
and don &amp; apos ; t use the german word for predictors , which would be prophet .
now , essentially we &amp; apos ; re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
this may sound strange , but i &amp; apos ; m a big fan of the concrete block .
why didn &amp; apos ; t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
and i love this : &amp; quot ; watson vanquishes human opponents . &amp; quot ;
this is a generation that &amp; apos ; s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
it &amp; apos ; s generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city .
&amp; quot ; because you have been holding it since this morning , &amp; quot ; he said .
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
and if you &amp; apos ; re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
in the summer of 2009 , honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis .
what &amp; apos ; s interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &amp; apos ; lounge .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &amp; apos ; d win the race .
the act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &amp; apos ; s a completely different thing .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
you mustn &amp; apos ; t say that , because that would be a little politically incorrect .
and here there &amp; apos ; s this story about the wife of the bishop of worcester .
that &amp; apos ; s why composers depend on us interpreters to reinvent the pieces again and again .
they &amp; apos ; re on the rubbish tips , but also elsewhere in the landscape , right ?
so the it &amp; apos ; s not as efficient , but it &amp; apos ; s basically doable .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
and it &amp; apos ; s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
now if i look at those programs , i can &amp; apos ; t tell you how they work .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceo &amp; apos ; s say it .
and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
and his brother said , &amp; quot ; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
with this information we realized there &amp; apos ; s a lot of in<<unk>> encies in the system .
but there &amp; apos ; s a third possibility , an enticing , intriguing and frightening possibility .
it means &amp; quot ; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &amp; quot ;
gamers love to be attached to awe ##AT##-##AT## inspiring missions to human planetary ##AT##-##AT## scale stories .
that has to do with us going back to the fourteenth
so it &amp; apos ; s about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wetland .
we just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run ##AT##-##AT## of ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## mill electrochemical battery .
in in china a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ?
that means we &amp; apos ; re losing five ##AT##-##AT## thousand times more than what is formed in the soil .
all that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real living space .
you need biological materials , but you also need tools , and that &amp; apos ; s a laboratory .
is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future .
think of this : we have a four ##AT##-##AT## letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &amp; apos ; ve created a noise machine .
because i was there in &amp; apos ; 71 , studying a lagoon in west africa .
we can get them to do things that they don &amp; apos ; t think they can do .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
it &amp; apos ; s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
if we were captured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition .
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
the gray boxes don &amp; apos ; t run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
and after , as i reflected on that , i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
and that &amp; apos ; s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &amp; apos ; ve go to the needle .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
that made the whole thing considerably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
the unhealthy shame i &amp; apos ; m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
in fact , i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
and it &amp; apos ; s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd ##AT##-##AT## sourcing game .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
nasa has this phrase that they like : &amp; quot ; failure is not an option . &amp; quot ;
tell me about the &amp; quot ; why &amp; quot ; phase -- what does that do for us ?
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
but not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &amp; apos ; t testify without armed guards .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?

the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e. <<unk>> .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i assign 20 percent less work than i used to .

in holland it &amp; apos ; s easier to understand this , because holland built the country on flowers .
and our approach was to say , okay , that you don &amp; apos ; t actually have to do that .
that &amp; apos ; s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six ##AT##-##AT## inch layer on top .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x174 .
but you ask the indians , and they say , &amp; quot ; the plants talk to us . &amp; quot ;
and you &amp; apos ; ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
and if your employees can &amp; apos ; t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &amp; quot ;
now you might think that all this breaking ##AT##-##AT## down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &amp; apos ; re really quite distinct .
or &amp; quot ; how was your trip to albania ? &amp; quot ; or something like that .
you &amp; apos ; re not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you &amp; apos ; re not .

so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- woof !
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &amp; apos ; ve actually taken .
and let &amp; apos ; s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &amp; quot ;
and i think that that &amp; apos ; s what we &amp; apos ; re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter -- first ##AT##-##AT## grader , not much artistic talent ...
and as we &amp; apos ; re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .

she looks at him and says , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m here for super sex . &amp; quot ;
another example from a very different field . monet painted his waterlilies an infinite number of times .

if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &amp; apos ; s begin with a bit of baseball .

because he led you down a path he &amp; apos ; s not on himself .
we can &amp; apos ; t just do that .
and the child will play , after thinking for a moment .
and this trades under the names open knowledge and citizen science .
i &amp; apos ; d like to explain that a little more .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
the brand that i am is , i would call it casual fly .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .

over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
a project i recently started was the building of a gene gun .

so i &amp; apos ; m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
when countries get together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &amp; apos ; t just discuss the co2 .
it &amp; apos ; s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
a lie like that shows you that the <<unk>> himself doesn &amp; apos ; t believe what he says .
that means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perceive things .
the interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simultaneously the media producer and medium .

we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of maa<<unk>> ht .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .

i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them .
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
but what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
or c , because you were told that you aren &amp; apos ; t suitable .
but even if you implement these indications , it still just remains something technical .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
i would like to talk to you about why many e ##AT##-##AT## health projects fail .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
this is a project called photosynth , which really <<unk>> es two different technologies .
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .

you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?

in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
which i would very much regret , because music is a lovely , communicative thing .
everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential .

what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
they said , &amp; quot ; let &amp; apos ; s present this to the leaders of our country . &amp; quot ;
climate skeptics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &amp; apos ; re wrong ?

no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a <<unk>> ant in the quality of someone &amp; apos ; s life .

in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t have anything to do , in specifics , with centrifuges , with uranium enrichment .

they &amp; apos ; re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the <<unk>> s .
the family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
so we don &amp; apos ; t have to worry that other targets might be hit by stuxnet .
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that herodotus &amp; apos ; crazy story is actually true .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self &amp; apos ; s life ?
let &amp; apos ; s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
so , i shelved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .

and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &amp; apos ; re aware of is human language .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
i &amp; apos ; m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so &amp; quot ; nyan cat &amp; quot ; is a looped animation with looped music .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
my opinion is that the mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
so let &amp; apos ; s go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk .
then my answer is , but i &amp; apos ; m sure you can say whether you like it or not .
and even when we think about the future , we don &amp; apos ; t think of our future normally as experiences .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling ##AT##-##AT## water temperatures .

and the people in the back go , &amp; quot ; ok , i didn &amp; apos ; t really see that . &amp; quot ;
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
it &amp; apos ; s the first biological rucksack , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle .
now i &amp; apos ; ve argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
but , what makes voodoo so interesting is that it &amp; apos ; s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &amp; apos ; ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
so we &amp; apos ; re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
now just to give you some perspective , i &amp; apos ; m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
technology &amp; apos ; s not the way you want to describe something somebody &amp; apos ; s putting in their armpit .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on ebay .
so for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &amp; apos ; t overlook it .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
well , let &amp; apos ; s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
and then it goes back to the back and it &amp; apos ; s not until then that whatever it is is actually seen .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs. drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
i would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you &amp; apos ; re probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level .
it &amp; apos ; s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &amp; quot ; oh , that team &amp; apos ; s going to win . &amp; quot ;
this didn &amp; apos ; t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &amp; apos ; s just because i don &amp; apos ; t play with particles very often .
this is energy farming , so you &amp; apos ; re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
and , in fact , these kids don &amp; apos ; t , so they &amp; apos ; re going out and reading their school work under the street lamps .
now in both cases , i didn &amp; apos ; t send them home and i don &amp; apos ; t think there was any gap in their care .
so , finally , the last game , we &amp; apos ; re launching it march 3rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &amp; quot ; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
it &amp; apos ; s a really , this graph , well i &amp; apos ; ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
yes , you &amp; apos ; ll sense it if you &amp; apos ; re feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right .
in both cases , these are gross underestimates , because we really aren &amp; apos ; t ferreting out the problem as we should .
we &amp; apos ; re able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
now i &amp; apos ; m an optimist , so i sort of think it &amp; apos ; s probably going to do something like that .
you &amp; apos ; ve heard it said before , but it &amp; apos ; s never been more true than today , that less is more .
we hope that this means no more pop ##AT##-##AT## ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn &amp; apos ; t be necessary .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &amp; apos ; re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
i think it &amp; apos ; s very haughty of us to think that we &amp; apos ; re the end product of evolution .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &amp; apos ; re not complaining about it , they &amp; apos ; re fixing it .
i don &amp; apos ; t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &amp; apos ; ve seen in those documentaries .
and if you look , for example , in the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and nature &amp; apos ; s god .
and , listen , everyone &amp; apos ; s entitled to their opinion ; they &amp; apos ; re even entitled to their opinion about progress .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &amp; apos ; t have to give people many instructions .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
and there &amp; apos ; s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
he said , &amp; quot ; no ; they do it because the food &amp; apos ; s better . &amp; quot ;
so no more saving , abstaining from , avoiding , reducing , no more guilt management , but intelligent waste .
if you want to know how sea level rises from land ##AT##-##AT## base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
you don &amp; apos ; t want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or even the wrong salad dressing .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board ##AT##-##AT## certified doctors .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
you know , often , people say , &amp; quot ; i don &amp; apos ; t know how to cut .
they &amp; apos ; ve helped companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark discover that brand personality .
and then he says three words -- the most unemotional three words i &amp; apos ; ve ever heard .
and i want to say , &amp; quot ; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &amp; quot ;
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?

and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable .
i mean , when we met i was delivering you from your mother &amp; apos ; s womb . &amp; quot ;
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &amp; apos ; s performance .
and now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem .
so you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language .
for the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design .
intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality .
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &amp; apos ; s called superconducting wire .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
here &amp; apos ; s an example . for those of you who aren &amp; apos ; t new yorkers , i apologize .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &amp; apos ; re wearing bright red pants .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands , there &amp; apos ; s always something specific and important to be done .
some of you might be thinking , &amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s a lot of time to spend playing games .

and then he &amp; apos ; s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and <<unk>> es and strange aquatic plants .
then i ask you this , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &amp; apos ; t sing ?
and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job . &amp; quot ;
another thing that &amp; apos ; s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &amp; apos ; s not possible , make it possible .
in that case , what i &amp; apos ; ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
apparently , there was such a severe famine that the king of lydia decided that they had to do something crazy .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &amp; apos ; s most urgent problems .
are they saying that there &amp; apos ; s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .

and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , i realized , well , this is a directed attack .
another quick example about sensing : it &amp; apos ; s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
and to this purpose people always come and look at our experimental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island .
i think the greatest adversity that we &amp; apos ; ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel &amp; apos ; s eyes .
and the interesting thing about that is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs .
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along , and many people do .
and we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash ##AT##-##AT## strapped schools all across america .
so , for the next world ##AT##-##AT## saving game , we decided to aim higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
but to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
while anytime i do an interview with someone , i can say , &amp; quot ; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
if we had twenty percent in europe , we &amp; apos ; d immediately have the same problems the people on that island have .
now you probably think that the composer , when writing down the notes , already includes everything they &amp; apos ; ve thought of .
because you project an assumption that you &amp; apos ; re seeing something you <<unk>> se to the front , such as a circle .
another project , that came from from the french group in paris , did work , and that &amp; apos ; s pretty cool .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
it &amp; apos ; s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and because i was up too late , wasn &amp; apos ; t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and ship<<unk>> ks and images in my imagination .

i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
i was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &amp; apos ; room , until one teacher saved my life .
feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender , so there &amp; apos ; s nothing feminine about feminism . &amp; quot ;
but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn &amp; apos ; t react to the testosterone .
okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing : gamers are super ##AT##-##AT## empowered , hopeful individuals .
and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high ##AT##-##AT## agility movements .

in a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the spanish .
practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predictors .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .

but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
there was an energy there , an implacable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
he &amp; apos ; s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee .

and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
in my own humanity and mistakes , i &amp; apos ; ve tried to get better at everything i tried .
so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should retain .
our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &amp; quot ;
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pixels , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
but , you know , it &amp; apos ; s really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn &amp; apos ; t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info ##AT##-##AT## graphic .
and in this other image at the top i have a lecture in in copenhagen at the medical <<unk>> ion in combination with an exhibition on the topic .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
so when they &amp; apos ; re faced with the problem of government , they don &amp; apos ; t care as much about using their voices .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
and it &amp; apos ; s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
but then , once we have the pixels , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation .
and i studied in my little garret at the nurses &amp; apos ; residence at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .

&amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s fine , &amp; quot ; says george , &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; ll take the soup . &amp; quot ;
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &amp; apos ; s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
i think bach would have been very enthusiastic if he &amp; apos ; d had the tonal possibilities that today &amp; apos ; s modern pianos have .
we actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &amp; apos ; t actually believe makes sense .

my mother , mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
there &amp; apos ; s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
we took a look at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
and even the ones who didn &amp; apos ; t literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
&amp; quot ; what is life ? &amp; quot ; is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &amp; quot ; we &amp; apos ; ve run out of oil .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way of engaging with the building became something different .
well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .

the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
a colored capsule , that &amp; apos ; s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
the nice thing is that i &amp; apos ; ve experienced that scientists have been joining my side in the last couple of years .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &amp; apos ; s very little , but it &amp; apos ; s always with me .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &amp; quot ; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
right ? a syringe with some inert -- a couple ccs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ...
and , you know , terrapower , if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
ok . a farm that doesn &amp; apos ; t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
but if you want to hook up several of these power inverters and they are supposed to construct a network , it becomes highly complicated .

the so ##AT##-##AT## called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here .

now there &amp; apos ; s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
so after a four ##AT##-##AT## year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .

she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .
in this mind knowledge was retrieved , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too .

that &amp; apos ; s what i always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in berlin ##AT##-##AT## adlershof .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &amp; apos ; re going to move it where we want to move it .
all those things stemmed and started from one place , and for me they stemmed and started with my family in west virginia .
it &amp; apos ; s the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .

we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion ##AT##-##AT## plus barrels of oil -- that &amp; apos ; s a hundred million barrels a day .
and it &amp; apos ; s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
what we &amp; apos ; re done here is we &amp; apos ; ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &amp; apos ; s also true of the stories that we make up .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &amp; apos ; re there , and what we &amp; apos ; re doing .
now , i don &amp; apos ; t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild .
so some of what i &amp; apos ; ve worked on , for example , is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body .
design is critical , and if you &amp; apos ; re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four gearshifts , to 56 car colors , high choice .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &amp; apos ; t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water , and then projections on them .
we piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &amp; apos ; ve tracked them for the three years since .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
you will then rather have to go to a seasonal reservoir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night .
we need this lie here , to keep the deception upright , without which we wouldn &amp; apos ; t be able to go on living .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &amp; apos ; t keep up with it .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &amp; apos ; s a chance in a million of those things .
one billion -- that &amp; apos ; s more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
the plant biomass , the phytoplan<<unk>> , the zooplan<<unk>> , it &amp; apos ; s what feeds the fish .
which is that to make music on an instrument one &amp; apos ; s own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance .
i get the entire overview , can filter this and can say , now show me all the things with chocolate , for example .
now in order to do that i &amp; apos ; m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because people often come and ask , can &amp; apos ; t you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ?
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &amp; quot ; this is going to be a whole new world , &amp; quot ; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
either it &amp; apos ; s going to turn into a sort of classical s ##AT##-##AT## curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &amp; apos ; s going to do this .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &amp; apos ; s no billboards , there &amp; apos ; s no posters , there &amp; apos ; s no fliers , nothing .
just as an aside , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth &amp; apos ; s crust , but they are 50 percent of the world &amp; apos ; s population .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &amp; # 91 ; of &amp; # 93 ; , like london &amp; apos ; s new mountaintop .
the sun doesn &amp; apos ; t shine all day , it doesn &amp; apos ; t shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn &amp; apos ; t blow all the time .
and so what i &amp; apos ; m trying to ask , what i &amp; apos ; ve been asking myself , is what &amp; apos ; s this new way that the world is ?
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know -- i &amp; apos ; m not at all comfortable with that assumption .
and i don &amp; apos ; t mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children .
and , as computers in open air , they &amp; apos ; re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated .
when i get off this stage i &amp; apos ; m not going to have plus ##AT##-##AT## one speaking , and plus ##AT##-##AT## one crazy idea , plus ##AT##-##AT## 20 crazy idea .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &amp; quot ; excuse me , can you not see that i &amp; apos ; m driving ? &amp; quot ;
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &amp; apos ; s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .

around the world , there &amp; apos ; s 700 million people who say they &amp; apos ; d like to move permanently someplace else right now .
i &amp; apos ; ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &amp; apos ; t standard for male or female .
if the trade ##AT##-##AT## off you get into is , &amp; quot ; let &amp; apos ; s make energy super expensive , &amp; quot ; then the rich can afford that .
it &amp; apos ; s also really wonderful when i &amp; apos ; m on stage with my musical other half and we &amp; apos ; re on the same wavelength .
now we &amp; apos ; re trying to ask , &amp; quot ; can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &amp; quot ;

the bottom line of what i &amp; apos ; ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well ##AT##-##AT## being .
we &amp; apos ; re more on the symbolic , on the semantic level there , something we designers are also preoccupied with .

it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a <<unk>> ation of their path through the cycle of life .

and if they &amp; apos ; re on a smartphone on google , they &amp; apos ; ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
i will clarify this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too , do have a natural relation to virtuality .
and so , overall here , if we &amp; apos ; re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
thank you . so to understand more about terrapower , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
but here &amp; apos ; s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &amp; apos ; re not that good at doing that .
so we &amp; apos ; re the amoebas and we can &amp; apos ; t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &amp; apos ; re creating .
at most , they &amp; apos ; d stick a feather on somebody &amp; apos ; s nose , and if it twitched , they didn &amp; apos ; t bury them yet .
she said , &amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &amp; apos ; ll always take care of her . &amp; quot ;

and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &amp; apos ; re less burdened by the presence of it .
and of course we hope that we &amp; apos ; ll expand in a similar way and also be similarly networked , so that more people can get involved .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human ##AT##-##AT## computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .

if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
one should eat the food that is lovingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .

and i spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
and the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercially , they start at about four thousand euros at the least .
one day , los angeles times columnist steve lopez was walking along the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
sometimes people tell me that i look like i &amp; apos ; m playing dress ##AT##-##AT## up , or that i remind them of their seven ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old .
i spend most of my time in very low ##AT##-##AT## income communities in the projects and places where there &amp; apos ; s a great deal of hopelessness .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi ##AT##-##AT## resolution experience .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a.i. dupont institute in wil<<unk>> ton , delaware .
i have a company that does design and animation , so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
i sent out some facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 ted talk .

there &amp; apos ; s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &amp; apos ; ve beaten us badly .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very upscale grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly upscale .
and i know you know what i &amp; apos ; m talking about , because i know you &amp; apos ; ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it &amp; apos ; s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
it &amp; apos ; s certainly now it &amp; apos ; s that &amp; apos ; s still not cheap , but it &amp; apos ; s certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible .
i should just put it bluntly , because we &amp; apos ; re all sort of friends here now -- it &amp; apos ; s exce<<unk>> gly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
so sex is really complicated ; it &amp; apos ; s not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , mrs. posten , who said , &amp; quot ; i need to see you .

now , i &amp; apos ; m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &amp; apos ; s problems -- since there &amp; apos ; s more to bonobo life than the kama sutra .
and you saw ty &amp; apos ; s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the convol<<unk>> program right before your eyes .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &amp; apos ; re not just consumers , and we &amp; apos ; re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &amp; apos ; t want giant fields of the same thing , that &amp; apos ; s wrong .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &amp; apos ; ll stay with the game until it &amp; apos ; s over .
today , i don &amp; apos ; t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning , and he &amp; apos ; s flying to lax , right now he &amp; apos ; s over ohio .
she took me out back and she said , &amp; quot ; bryan , i &amp; apos ; m going to tell you something , but you don &amp; apos ; t tell anybody what i tell you . &amp; quot ;

and by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in germany the most suitable purification plant is the one in <<unk>> furt .

it &amp; apos ; s necessary to have one &amp; apos ; s own experiences and idea of music to then make it resonate through a further possibility , which is an instrument .
and i wonder what you &amp; apos ; d choose , because i &amp; apos ; ve been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one .

they cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , &amp; quot ; maybe these agencies don &amp; apos ; t have my best interest in mind .

some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis , which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it .
we &amp; apos ; ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &amp; apos ; s no reason we shouldn &amp; apos ; t have .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &amp; apos ; s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
because with 50 funds to choose from , it &amp; apos ; s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you &amp; apos ; ll just put it off until tomorrow .
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn &amp; apos ; t recognize , it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .

dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
they look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes , also electronic tinkering , and combine this in a very outlandish way .
their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the <<unk>> went switched on .
mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry .

that means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life receiving stories .
it was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it successively and relatively naturally .
my response to him was , &amp; quot ; well , have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery ? &amp; quot ;
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
and then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &amp; quot ; i thought you knew something about plants .
and it &amp; apos ; s just standard selection : we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
i think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology , etc .
this means that the entire history of western civilization is characterized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers .
we &amp; apos ; ve been given over ten million funded projects , also to attach a ten ##AT##-##AT## megawatt battery to the german network .
obviously it &amp; apos ; s clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
and i probably have consumed my memories of that three ##AT##-##AT## week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &amp; apos ; s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .

they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy , not the difference in anatomy , and that was a really radical thing to do .
you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &amp; apos ; re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .

so you see , we &amp; apos ; re navigating the web for the first time as if it &amp; apos ; s actually a web , not from page ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and i think what we &amp; apos ; ve learned is that , if you &amp; apos ; re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &amp; apos ; re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .

it &amp; apos ; s easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they &amp; apos ; re isolated , that they &amp; apos ; re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &amp; quot ; aren &amp; apos ; t you afraid -- aren &amp; apos ; t you afraid you &amp; apos ; re never going to be able to top that ?

so there are a number of people who have a lot more &amp; quot ; uh ##AT##-##AT## oh &amp; quot ; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
what is particularly impressive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we &amp; apos ; ve anchored the ability to think in a non ##AT##-##AT## linear way in our biological memory .
we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
there are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
suppose you have appendicitis and you &amp; apos ; re referred to a surgeon who &amp; apos ; s batting 400 on appendectomies .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &amp; quot ; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &amp; apos ; t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid &amp; apos ; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
that means , attention , now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because i will not be held responsible for what might happen .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
and secondly , we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it .
a colleague of mine got access to investment records from vanguard , the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces .
and that is kind of our vision of sensible energy use and i am grateful to the cradle to cradle institute that they said , use solar power .
these are the first shoes with which you make a jackrabbit start at the pedestrian lights and the rubber sole can go into biological cycles , okay ?
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and finally , he says , &amp; quot ; look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &amp; quot ;
they were moving away from supernatural explanations , and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power , where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &amp; apos ; t usually do .
the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &amp; apos ; s trying to infect is actually running on that target .
if the divine , cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be <<unk>> sed , for just one moment through your efforts , then &amp; quot ; <<unk>> ! &amp; quot ;
so as i do this , i &amp; apos ; m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
so , i suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &amp; apos ; ll do the first bad part behind it .
so , here i was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &amp; quot ; avatar , &amp; quot ; coming up with new technology that didn &amp; apos ; t exist before .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school .
this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &amp; apos ; re just as messed up as anybody else is .
yes , 97.5 percent is saltwater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in english and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it &amp; apos ; s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
up till now the following is always argued in discussions , these islanders are becoming self ##AT##-##AT## sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network .
that probably doesn &amp; apos ; t mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your employer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50 ##AT##-##AT## letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together .
they go , &amp; quot ; well , he &amp; apos ; s certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &amp; apos ; s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real ##AT##-##AT## world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
so we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &amp; apos ; s structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
what i want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
and there &amp; apos ; s nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self ##AT##-##AT## feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
nathaniel dropped out of juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus , she actually has testes inside , and she has a y chromosome .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &amp; quot ; professor romer , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the tedtalk .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
and i &amp; apos ; ve learned that that deep ##AT##-##AT## ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
we &amp; apos ; ll start by putting a lead into two sequence siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high ##AT##-##AT## tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
it &amp; apos ; s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3d cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
the payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
it could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite tom .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions : the less we emit , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &amp; apos ; ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
if we don &amp; apos ; t , if we continue to act the way we &amp; apos ; re acting , we &amp; apos ; re guilty of something that i don &amp; apos ; t think we want to be guilty of : high ##AT##-##AT## tech colonialism .
and finally , in the end , i think it &amp; apos ; s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &amp; apos ; ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &amp; apos ; re not remote at all .
we &amp; apos ; re actually starting at a new point : we &amp; apos ; ve been digitizing biology , and now we &amp; apos ; re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
you need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you &amp; apos ; d only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software .
and even if the answer to the question is &amp; quot ; no , &amp; quot ; it &amp; apos ; s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &amp; apos ; s soccer game very different than it would &amp; apos ; ve been .
and maybe that &amp; apos ; s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond anatomy , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
this man was dr. kean , a man that i had only known about through my mother &amp; apos ; s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
it &amp; apos ; s able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- at less than two cents a liter .
and you don &amp; apos ; t have -- as an <<unk>> ker -- you don &amp; apos ; t have to deliver this payload by a usb stick , as we saw it in the case of stuxnet .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are , there &amp; apos ; s some uncertainty there , but not very much .
i find the last two words under &amp; quot ; near antonyms , &amp; quot ; particularly unsettling : &amp; quot ; whole &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; wholesome . &amp; quot ;
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
we have second- and third ##AT##-##AT## generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher ##AT##-##AT## value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
now , if i want to just kind of take a peek at these , i might think , &amp; quot ; well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &amp; quot ;
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e ##AT##-##AT## health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
one of the places we &amp; apos ; re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
but the ninth largest retailer , the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is aldi , and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
here &amp; apos ; s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes .
and that was then it &amp; apos ; s not binding , but it &amp; apos ; s yes , i think it has managed to become accepted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes .
and the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom .
that means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say , okay ,
we only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &amp; apos ; t get back by yourself .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
at that time , there were self ##AT##-##AT## governing companies and one of them was in kreuzberg in mehringhof , where people thought evil took place .
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink fl<<unk>> gos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
well , it &amp; apos ; s good , except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year ##AT##-##AT## old man with a sore throat .
we &amp; apos ; re looking to see if we can take captured co2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
now , the most mindless epidemic we &amp; apos ; re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
so as you all recall , what our founding fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth .
next came the successful civil rights movement , where we found people like sojourner truth talking about , &amp; quot ; ain &amp; apos ; t i a woman ? &amp; quot ;
unlike the one ##AT##-##AT## way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
the fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn &amp; apos ; t break through to the other things .
because we &amp; apos ; d really have to prove whether the soul exists or not .
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
what they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
and the source was a man , an african ##AT##-##AT## american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
and now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
it looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind .
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
one , we battered down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate -- a stephen hawking machine .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
i will have more life experience than today and so my musical palette will have many more nuances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now .
only things that are subject to wear and tear , such as shoe soles , brake coverings , car tyres , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems .
we can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps .
at this point and if you &amp; apos ; re laughing , you &amp; apos ; ll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , &amp; quot ; well , we don &amp; apos ; t know what the target is .
and i found that because there weren &amp; apos ; t video games and this saturation of cg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &amp; apos ; s no wonder that we &amp; apos ; re pessimistic .
&amp; quot ; that &amp; apos ; s right , &amp; quot ; he said . &amp; quot ; we &amp; apos ; re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &amp; quot ;
do you have a perspective -- i don &amp; apos ; t want to use &amp; quot ; angle &amp; quot ; because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &amp; apos ; s patients without even having to contact him .
and the reasoning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population .
i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said , &amp; quot ; i don &amp; apos ; t want to achieve immortality through my work .
if you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
and it &amp; apos ; s really clear , if you look at the history of the founding fathers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &amp; apos ; s that large things don &amp; apos ; t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
it &amp; apos ; s very different than saying &amp; quot ; we &amp; apos ; re a <<unk>> ve ##AT##-##AT## foot ##AT##-##AT## high truck trying to get under a ten ##AT##-##AT## foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . &amp; quot ;
and it &amp; apos ; s often not until she hits puberty and she &amp; apos ; s growing and developing breasts , but she &amp; apos ; s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &amp; apos ; s up here .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &amp; apos ; ve done a task that you can &amp; apos ; t explain to someone else .
potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &amp; apos ; re going away , and they &amp; apos ; re going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we &amp; apos ; re going away too .
and by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &amp; apos ; s only allowed with quantum mechanics .
so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , &amp; quot ; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &amp; apos ; s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &amp; quot ; oh his father is six feet tall , &amp; quot ; how much would you know about his height ?
and if you &amp; apos ; re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian herodotus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
and most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inherit the wisdom , that we &amp; apos ; ll need to make these choices wisely ?
play &amp; apos ; s a shape<<unk>> ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew .
and part of me also wonders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &amp; apos ; s scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fmri ?
and the second aspect is that since we because of these archaic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual manner , although we use a <<unk>> fied language today .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &amp; apos ; t born with this notion , you developed it .
it &amp; apos ; s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &amp; apos ; s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
and it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
so , the other grade is : are we deploying this zero ##AT##-##AT## emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &amp; apos ; re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i &amp; apos ; m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today &amp; apos ; s pressing challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
because as i said in the beginning , it &amp; apos ; s an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
this is the greatest time there &amp; apos ; s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease ...
and , you know , i was already bargaining , as a five year ##AT##-##AT## old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
and by the way , we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &amp; apos ; t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &amp; quot ; what &amp; apos ; s up ?
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
when i think about creating abundance , it &amp; apos ; s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &amp; apos ; s about creating a life of possibility .
and all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &amp; apos ; t -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the error ##AT##-##AT## prone health professionals , well there won &amp; apos ; t be anybody left .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
from darwin &amp; apos ; s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
it always makes for a happy concert when i have the fortune to experience the piece anew , even though i &amp; apos ; ve been working on it for so long in advance .
now , of all the peoples that i &amp; apos ; ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the kogi of the sierra nevada de santa marta in northern colombia .
well in egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &amp; apos ; s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when , now it &amp; apos ; s happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level .
because , of course , it &amp; apos ; s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
and he &amp; apos ; s going to land in a couple of hours , he &amp; apos ; s going to rent a car , and he &amp; apos ; s going to come to long beach , and he &amp; apos ; s going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight .
what &amp; apos ; s incredible for me is the projects that i &amp; apos ; ve gotten the most feedback out of , or i &amp; apos ; ve had the most success in , are ones where i &amp; apos ; ve interacted with things directly .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &amp; apos ; t be working .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most honourable thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ?
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases .
so , according to herodotus , they invented dice games and they set up a <<unk>> dom ##AT##-##AT## wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , i have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &amp; apos ; s right here .
now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &amp; apos ; re trying to create a process that &amp; apos ; s extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
now i don &amp; apos ; t want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you spend all that time imagining that conception , you &amp; apos ; re not going to listen to me .
to paraphrase : it &amp; apos ; s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congress , and it &amp; apos ; s in the 300 megapixel range .
bg : well , we need -- for one of these high ##AT##-##AT## scale , electro ##AT##-##AT## generation things that &amp; apos ; s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
i personally think that it &amp; apos ; s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &amp; apos ; t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it &amp; apos ; s also apt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &amp; apos ; re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
and i said aloud , &amp; quot ; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &amp; apos ; t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?

i said , &amp; quot ; miguel , isn &amp; apos ; t a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &amp; quot ;
and it &amp; apos ; s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &amp; apos ; re inefficient . take tuna , a major drawback .
i was seventeen when i took part in a course of his and played the last of chopin &amp; apos ; s four ballads , one of his later works .
this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relevance in the area of in the research area usability and especially in the area user experience .
and if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology .
now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &amp; apos ; s easy to refute .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &amp; quot ; different ways of being , &amp; quot ; i really do mean different ways of being .
and so i consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
so you &amp; apos ; re noticing a change is taking place , from a def<<unk>> attitude to to well , to the idea , one hundred percent renewable energies is right .
jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .

it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
now you &amp; apos ; ll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , archaic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc .

a project i set up myself with the hackteria network in switzerland , was one in which we wanted to create a so ##AT##-##AT## called optical trap or optical tweezers .
and this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre ##AT##-##AT## industrial times bitterly needed , because they didn &amp; apos ; t have anything .
we have all these amazing superpowers : blissful productivity , the ability to weave a tight social fabric , this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .

my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .
armstrong twittered about us , and then in december , time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
so it &amp; apos ; s just like from the hollywood movies where during the heist , the observation camera is fed with pr<<unk>> orded video .
and the biggest question i get asked nowadays is , &amp; quot ; did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &amp; quot ;
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .

and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here - ##AT##-##AT## - knows does not always behave rationally .
at the media campus , for example , we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this .
but before i show you what i &amp; apos ; ve got inside , i &amp; apos ; m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &amp; apos ; m outfit ##AT##-##AT## obsessed .
intuitive usability didn &amp; apos ; t start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when apple appeared on the scene , if i wanted to make technological devices usable for people .
this is what i call the &amp; quot ; i &amp; apos ; m not good at life &amp; quot ; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude : &amp; quot ; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &amp; quot ;

it &amp; apos ; s not that simple , but it &amp; apos ; s also not impossible , and if you &amp; apos ; re curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far .
it may seem like we &amp; apos ; re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &amp; quot ; opossum in my trashcan . can &amp; apos ; t tell if it &amp; apos ; s dead .
and i &amp; apos ; d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b.s .
and that &amp; apos ; s , well that &amp; apos ; s these are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody , is this fascination with technology .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &amp; apos ; s sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that &amp; apos ; s our fuel to begin with .
and i &amp; apos ; ve argued that we &amp; apos ; re about to perhaps create a new version of the cambrian explosion , where there &amp; apos ; s massive new speciation based on this digital design .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
it &amp; apos ; s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i &amp; apos ; m wearing , and we &amp; apos ; ve had great conversations .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &amp; quot ; well you know it &amp; apos ; s deeply troubling to hear what you &amp; apos ; re talking about . &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; m a mule , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really <<unk>> wardly .
another example is so ##AT##-##AT## called virtual reality as crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non ##AT##-##AT## existent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the holodeck .
yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , additional construction of coal ##AT##-##AT## burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn &amp; apos ; t have , or gas turbines , because that &amp; apos ; s not possible .
bg : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &amp; apos ; s not that dramatic .
according to burrelles , the movie premiered in january , and since then -- and this isn &amp; apos ; t even the whole thing -- we &amp; apos ; ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .

here you have the censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which switches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others .
we &amp; apos ; ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
that &amp; apos ; s why we &amp; apos ; ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
and because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people .
this isn &amp; apos ; t about rice krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &amp; apos ; s about time we started to understand what that meant .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .

for every nine people who have been executed , we &amp; apos ; ve actually identified one innocent person who &amp; apos ; s been exonerated and released from death row .
and we &amp; apos ; re just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capacities , the must ##AT##-##AT## run capacities , by putting electrochemical reservoirs in the network too .
we &amp; apos ; ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vodoun . and voodoo is not a black magic cult .
so these are really exciting processes , which take place accordingly in this , well , it &amp; apos ; s not really a grey area , but in this rose ##AT##-##AT## tinted area .
but then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .

a terrorist place , but it was was called wuseltronik and it made wind and solar power and that &amp; apos ; s where i started out in the mid ##AT##-##AT## eighties .
we &amp; apos ; re a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &amp; apos ; re going to be happy we do .
but the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theorem were false from the start , so of course you &amp; apos ; d have accept the opposite without any proof .
i can make bach &amp; apos ; s tonal ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a baroque harpsichord was not able to .
he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her <<unk>> t tails because she couldn &amp; apos ; t bear to be without him .
if your work was brilliant you couldn &amp; apos ; t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
it has a megawatt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it &amp; apos ; s the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation .
because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &amp; quot ; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &amp; quot ;
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , <<unk>> -fest and all ##AT##-##AT## night sessions , tony drew again for the first time in seven years .

in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in june or july , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
and the envelope pushed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &amp; apos ; t going to be able to do this for a while .
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the etruscans , who then led to the roman empire , actually share the same dna as the ancient lydians .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
and so my recommendation , it &amp; apos ; s the only one i will provide , is for cameron to do &amp; quot ; avatar ii &amp; quot ; underwater .
and as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navigate through there , from island to island , to find food .
and funnily enough it was developed at the bbc mannheim , called abb today , in the seventies , and was then licensed to the japanese .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &amp; quot ; linguistic exogamy : &amp; quot ; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
i call it neo ##AT##-##AT## evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .

then she said , &amp; quot ; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &amp; apos ; ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &amp; quot ;
and that &amp; apos ; s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
there &amp; apos ; s common , there &amp; apos ; s typical . there &amp; apos ; s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?

but here &amp; apos ; s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &amp; apos ; ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
they were simply told , &amp; quot ; these are the &amp; apos ; a ##AT##-##AT## students , &amp; apos ; these are the &amp; apos ; d ##AT##-##AT## students . &amp; apos ; &amp; quot ; and that &amp; apos ; s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
and yes , so you can see that it &amp; apos ; s a relatively relatively heterogeneous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big i mean , larger organisations , who are doing this more formally in an institutionalised form already .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &amp; quot ; so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &amp; quot ;
now for those of us who &amp; apos ; ve given up on government , it &amp; apos ; s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .

ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &amp; apos ; ve collapsed .
this means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audible , concrete , non ##AT##-##AT## verbal musical language .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &amp; quot ;
but you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way .
we &amp; apos ; ve got a graphic novel , we &amp; apos ; ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
and he says , &amp; quot ; we &amp; apos ; re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &amp; quot ;
so let &amp; apos ; s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .

so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000 ##AT##-##AT## letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is as we clear the george washington bridge , which was by not a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel one real regret .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the greeks and the romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability , and , although there &amp; apos ; s many directions people are seeking , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &amp; apos ; t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
the other hat that i &amp; apos ; ve worn in my work is as an activist , as a patient advocate -- or , as i sometimes say , as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
it happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher professor jürgen ude , a well ##AT##-##AT## known beethoven specialist , concert pianist and longstanding professor at the conservatory here in stuttgart .
you know jerry bruck<<unk>> movies , you form a dream team -- you &amp; apos ; ve got the astronaut , the scientist , the ex ##AT##-##AT## convict , and they all have something to do to save the world .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
the congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &amp; apos ; ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it &amp; apos ; s a very simple trick <<unk>> logically .
in both my vocation at robin hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but i &amp; apos ; m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &amp; apos ; s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ?
so that &amp; apos ; s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you .
it &amp; apos ; s also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that &amp; apos ; s what you &amp; apos ; ve all heard about with cloning .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
now , the problem with collaborative online environments like world of warcraft is that it &amp; apos ; s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
and so i can have a very different view of the city , a very different impression , because i see negative and positive zones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and whenever you are in a city like maa<<unk>> ht and somebody collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest aed which can save lives .
i did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday .
he took one of these well , one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an eeg or something like that , so he was working with neurobiology , his his nickname is sam neurohack .
let me now introduce you to elegs that is worn by amanda boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
and so the message is this , we have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc .
now , i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
he simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . and as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or par<<unk>> .
here &amp; apos ; s an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
but the thing about <<unk>> ptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &amp; apos ; re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
i also want to say there are probably also some yellow labradors that i know that are more capable of informed , intelligent , mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## olds that i know .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old ##AT##-##AT## style evolution into neo ##AT##-##AT## evolution .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the morgan spurlock brand is a mindful / play brand .
it &amp; apos ; s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the lhc , colliding with a piece of the lhc deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
against that background i looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forgotten , and what is instinctive for us , so what difference does it make ?
this is how i &amp; apos ; ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &amp; apos ; ve been thinking in the last few months as i &amp; apos ; ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the <<unk>> ously , <<unk>> ingly over ##AT##-##AT## anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &amp; apos ; s like aspirin shaped -- it &amp; apos ; s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect .
and we know that it just doesn &amp; apos ; t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &amp; apos ; s going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we &amp; apos ; re doing just doesn &amp; apos ; t make any sense at all .
the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &amp; apos ; ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &amp; apos ; s why we have refrigerators , air ##AT##-##AT## conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
especially in today &amp; apos ; s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape , isn &amp; apos ; t the idea to get that new buzz ##AT##-##AT## worthy delivery vehicle that &amp; apos ; s going to get that message to the masses ?
and to see when something is intuitive of course and how i , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are a user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use .
because -- in the end it &amp; apos ; s like this , o.k. -- centuries ago in the deserts of north africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that i &amp; apos ; m in right now in my career .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital ##AT##-##AT## acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
if you &amp; apos ; re queasy -- if you faint easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &amp; apos ; t know , and one woman almost passed out .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &amp; apos ; s my boss -- and one has come from music .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
descendants of the ancient tairona civilization which once carpeted the caribbean coastal plain of colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the caribbean coastal plain .
most females like me -- i believe myself to be a typical female -- i don &amp; apos ; t actually know my <<unk>> somal make ##AT##-##AT## up but i think i &amp; apos ; m probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen ##AT##-##AT## sensitive .
and that being said , through honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &amp; quot ; embrace transparency , &amp; quot ; has been brought to you by my good friends at emc , who for $ 7,100 bought the naming rights on ebay .
and if you think about &amp; quot ; avatar , &amp; quot ; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery ?
and what you can do with it and approaching society very targetedly and asking , right , okay , what do you know , what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ?
and it was it developed in the area of software , but it &amp; apos ; s also found in the electronics sector where you also find a whole tinkerer scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuits .
what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap<<unk>> in both hemispheres at the same time .
and for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
so those are the three main <<unk>> kers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
the one thing i &amp; apos ; ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania , and i was standing over a bushel of tom<<unk>> .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
we there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ?
and i was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the best ##AT##-##AT## fitting jeans i had ever had .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a view port .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i slide from the present into the past so to speak , then i am well capable of bridging waiting times , in that he in that i keep someone occupied for three seconds .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &amp; apos ; t any longer grow readily in e. <<unk>> -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms .
so every morning i hop on my wifi scale and before i &amp; apos ; m in my car , people start talking to me , &amp; quot ; i think you need a light lunch today , lucien . &amp; quot ;
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &amp; quot ; everybody &amp; apos ; s on the dream team , and it &amp; apos ; s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &amp; quot ;
so , i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &amp; apos ; s been crushed doesn &amp; apos ; t have hope , it doesn &amp; apos ; t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self ##AT##-##AT## replicate in the laboratory , and we &amp; apos ; ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &amp; apos ; s batting 200 on <<unk>> oplasties .
and there &amp; apos ; s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## bone legs , i wouldn &amp; apos ; t have hesitated for a second .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &amp; apos ; t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
if we don &amp; apos ; t get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &amp; apos ; s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &amp; apos ; s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &amp; quot ; son , there &amp; apos ; s three sides to every story .
we &amp; apos ; re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &amp; apos ; s got a.i. , you can cough on it , you can do a finger blood prick .
but i have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that i know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally manageable as possible .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an xy <<unk>> somal basis , and that sry gene on the y chromosome tells the proto ##AT##-##AT## gonads , which we all have in the fetal life , to become testes .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world ##AT##-##AT## saving mission , right away .
you can heed the share by using one of these smart grids , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you &amp; apos ; ll never be able to do without the reservoir completely .
&amp; quot ; don , &amp; quot ; i said , &amp; quot ; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &amp; apos ; t pollute . &amp; quot ;
one of them is seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah snavely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co ##AT##-##AT## advised by steve seitz at u.w .
a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &amp; quot ; make something . &amp; quot ;
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms. parks turned to me and she said , &amp; quot ; now bryan , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &amp; apos ; re on the <<unk>> p of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
so i presented another fact ##AT##-##AT## filled lecture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
farms that aren &amp; apos ; t worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
this siftable is configured to show video , and if i tilt it in one direction , it &amp; apos ; ll roll the video this way ; if i tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards .
so , you know , here i am now , on the deck of titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate advisers who knew i was interested in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist , as i still do -- asked a really strange question .
the gallup organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
and nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at walt disney concert hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
i had somebody count the number of books with &amp; quot ; happiness &amp; quot ; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
so , i started a company with stan winston , my good friend stan winston , who is the premier make ##AT##-##AT## up and creature designer at that time , and it was called digital domain .
another thing from the usa that also had to do with paternity test thing , is the the pcr , the polymerase chain reaction , a complicated term .
there &amp; apos ; s a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
take , for example , this child of a barasana in the northwest amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
but since it didn &amp; apos ; t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &amp; quot ; oprah &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; larry king live . &amp; quot ;
the model already takes shape while you &amp; apos ; re still in your mother &amp; apos ; s womb and it &amp; apos ; s intercultural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present .
it &amp; apos ; s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &amp; apos ; t , those who can &amp; apos ; t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
he said , &amp; quot ; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &amp; quot ;
now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well ##AT##-##AT## being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &amp; quot ; hey guy , i love pink fl<<unk>> gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &amp; quot ;
and then i realized when he says , &amp; quot ; a farm that has no impurities , &amp; quot ; he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guadalquivir river .
so , consider this really interesting statistic ; it was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
they had 250 different kinds of <<unk>> ds and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of <<unk>> led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water .
and we started talking about music , from bach to beethoven and brahms , bruckner , all the b &amp; apos ; s , from bartók , all the way up to esa ##AT##-##AT## pekka salonen .
so , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &amp; apos ; re basically aliens right here on earth .
there &amp; apos ; s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &amp; apos ; s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won &amp; apos ; t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &amp; apos ; t support .
and even though the film didn &amp; apos ; t make any money -- barely broke even , i should say -- i witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
all of these techniques that i &amp; apos ; m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier , that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging , and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , does that affect people &amp; apos ; s likelihood to save more for tomorrow .
nowadays , the world we live in -- we affluent , industrialized citizens , with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
and then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super ##AT##-##AT## attributes , hyper ##AT##-##AT## capacities -- that better memory .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
if instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i ever lived with , the waorani of northeastern ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
now , having selected government , i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year .
and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for inter<<unk>> ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &amp; quot ; motion to try my poor , 14 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old black male client like a privileged , white 75 ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old corporate executive . &amp; quot ;

the coolest thing about this -- and this is what &amp; apos ; s completing the whole circle -- is that in april of this year , at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles , there &amp; apos ; s going to be an exhibition called &amp; quot ; art of the streets . &amp; quot ;
i &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about some stuff that &amp; apos ; s in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you &amp; apos ; ve already heard , and i &amp; apos ; ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
after the success of &amp; quot ; titanic , &amp; quot ; i said , &amp; quot ; ok , i &amp; apos ; m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i &amp; apos ; m going to go be a full ##AT##-##AT## time explorer for a while . &amp; quot ;
here &amp; apos ; s the problem : if i can &amp; apos ; t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &amp; apos ; t find the still ##AT##-##AT## small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we &amp; apos ; ll have to give up and we &amp; apos ; ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well ##AT##-##AT## being is .
but , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it &amp; apos ; s tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &amp; apos ; s no longer a glimpse of god .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
so it &amp; apos ; s not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that gamers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization , the sapling foundation -- a check for $ 7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year &amp; apos ; s ted .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles .
last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
i &amp; apos ; m grateful to the person behind premium cola that he <<unk>> itated that word again , because after the wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything left ##AT##-##AT## wing was bad .
and this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full ##AT##-##AT## time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
to show you how slowly this mechanism disappears and to illustrate the traces it leaves , which lead to something other than this grandiose image of ourselves , i would like to share another story with you .
and this kind of <<unk>> al , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action .

his name was dr. <<unk>> zuti<<unk>> , an italian american , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most americans to pronounce , so he went by dr. p .

in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small grace note .
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in <<unk>> stive heart failure .

and it &amp; apos ; s that mind ##AT##-##AT## heart connection that i believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and <<unk>> ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that &amp; apos ; s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
this year we celebrate the 200th birthday of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustrated , i think , a truth about the human character .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &amp; apos ; t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &amp; apos ; t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
so if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid ##AT##-##AT## 70s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it &amp; apos ; s the unfortunate fact that we can &amp; apos ; t think about any circumstance that affects well ##AT##-##AT## being without distorting its importance .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea .
telephony , computers , videotapes , cd ##AT##-##AT## roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &amp; apos ; ve now built within our society for handling that information .
the small warhead is taking one cascade , and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down , and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves .
with bacteria and archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
usability always means how can i reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satisfying way possible .
they created a 27,000 ##AT##-##AT## acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and spon<<unk>> , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
and , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability i &amp; apos ; ve had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions .
and then i went to berlin in the mid ##AT##-##AT## eighties because i wanted to study renewable energies and they didn &amp; apos ; t have that in karlsruhe .
it means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then i can make use of that as a designer .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space .
the nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anticipate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renewable energies .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us .
it &amp; apos ; s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , <<unk>> de runoff .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
i pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in buffalo , new york , right across the border from where we live .
and then it can leave you .
it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter . it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
the idea of terrapower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent , which is the u235 -- we decided , &amp; quot ; let &amp; apos ; s burn the 99 percent , the u238 . &amp; quot ;
you know , i went and pitched it to the studio as &amp; quot ; &amp; apos ; romeo and juliet &amp; apos ; on a ship : &amp; quot ; it &amp; apos ; s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &amp; quot ;
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six ##AT##-##AT## pack of beer -- i don &amp; apos ; t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and &amp; quot ; art of the streets &amp; quot ; is going to have pretty much the bad ##AT##-##AT## asses of the street art scene -- banksy , shepard fa<<unk>> y , kaws -- all of these guys will be there .
unless you &amp; apos ; re very close and you &amp; apos ; re just funding the learning curve and it &amp; apos ; s going to get very cheap , i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this : steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and <<unk>> ult ##AT##-##AT## to ##AT##-##AT## install child seats don &amp; apos ; t help . it &amp; apos ; s a waste of money .
i had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &amp; quot ; which is the test they &amp; apos ; re going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female ? &amp; quot ;
in both cases , it &amp; apos ; s not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to properly use these little muscles that attune the vocal chords .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
and it &amp; apos ; s exce<<unk>> gly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?
and as we get farther and farther with our science , we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we &amp; apos ; ve had are probably overly simplistic .
over the course of this film , we had 500 ##AT##-##AT## plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &amp; quot ; no , &amp; quot ; they didn &amp; apos ; t want any part of this project .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internally .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &amp; apos ; re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi ##AT##-##AT## log curve .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us something of a solution in his &amp; quot ; i have a dream &amp; quot ; speech .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
there &amp; apos ; s enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &amp; apos ; t buy them .
it says , &amp; apos ; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &amp; apos ; doesn &amp; apos ; t that make you feel confident ? &amp; quot ;
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
that &amp; apos ; s why i prefer to do it all in german , because if i &amp; apos ; d have to translate it into english , that would be like the translation of the translation of the translation .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
and i was blown away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
and 18 months ago , i had another job at google , and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &amp; apos ; s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
we &amp; apos ; re looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through the thing , re<<unk>> ging it in any way we want .
so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &amp; quot ; i want a pair of jeans . here &amp; apos ; s my size . &amp; quot ;
it &amp; apos ; s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
now let &amp; apos ; s take this back into my world of medicine where i &amp; apos ; m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &amp; apos ; m going to talk to you about .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mrs. drucker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread .
and even if they &amp; apos ; re all shut off , every minute that we &amp; apos ; re watching our kid mutilate a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , &amp; quot ; should i answer this cell phone call ?
there &amp; apos ; s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &amp; apos ; s lots of people who &amp; apos ; d like to go there .
and there &amp; apos ; s a generation out there that &amp; apos ; s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &amp; apos ; s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
i didn &amp; apos ; t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and i don &amp; apos ; t like fish skin ; i don &amp; apos ; t like it seared , i don &amp; apos ; t like it crispy .
there are different grades here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home , whether you only understand it passively or whether you can also actively speak it , all the way to the musical native speaker .
i &amp; apos ; d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth ##AT##-##AT## century persian poet named hafiz that my friend , jacques dembois told me about , and the poem is called &amp; quot ; the god who only knows four words &amp; quot ; : &amp; quot ; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &amp; apos ; ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &amp; apos ; come dance with me .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , i suspect , when defending his protege &amp; apos ; s useless experiments -- his protege was michael faraday -- said this , &amp; quot ; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our <<unk>> phs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &amp; quot ;
on my show , on &amp; quot ; white coat , black art , &amp; quot ; i made it a habit of saying , &amp; quot ; here &amp; apos ; s my worst mistake , &amp; quot ; i would say to everybody from <<unk>> dics to the chief of cardiac surgery , &amp; quot ; here &amp; apos ; s my worst mistake , &amp; quot ; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &amp; quot ; what about yours ? &amp; quot ; and i would point the microphone towards them .

one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &amp; apos ; s not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? -- it &amp; apos ; s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the girl scouts , you know , the halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school .
at one point , javier said to octavio , &amp; quot ; what if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the u.s. embassy ; give some to the canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? &amp; quot ;
and at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &amp; apos ; re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . and the priest steps back and says , &amp; quot ; you see ? it &amp; apos ; s really as i &amp; apos ; ve told you .
and now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an airy nature , it &amp; apos ; s called anima in latin , being like a breath of air .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
and what we &amp; apos ; re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &amp; apos ; re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away <<unk>> led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well ##AT##-##AT## being .
right , i &amp; apos ; d like to summarise my my presentation by stating that the characteristics and abilities that we acquired during the age of feudalism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be reactivated with the help of the so ##AT##-##AT## called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser pattie , and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , <<unk>> ging it the way we wanted ?
if somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta ##AT##-##AT## verse , using everybody else &amp; apos ; s photos , and do a kind of a cross ##AT##-##AT## modal and cross ##AT##-##AT## user social experience that way .
when you come back to the shore and you say , &amp; quot ; we had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human ##AT##-##AT## performance aspects of working at sea , &amp; quot ; you can &amp; apos ; t explain it to people . it &amp; apos ; s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine ##AT##-##AT## year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &amp; apos ; s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections , so the local government can &amp; apos ; t snoop on their discussions .
and i &amp; apos ; m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &amp; apos ; s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert downey jr. acting as steve lopez , and jamie foxx as nathaniel anthony ayers , the juilliard ##AT##-##AT## trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard evan shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 1930s -- i used to argue that you couldn &amp; apos ; t classify these <<unk>> ptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &amp; apos ; re under the effects there &amp; apos ; s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the founding fathers &amp; apos ; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &amp; quot ; the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &amp; apos ; t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &amp; quot ;
there &amp; apos ; s not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the asmat or in the chilling winds of tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self ##AT##-##AT## consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
a huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it &amp; apos ; s crazy again , it starts with people saying , what &amp; apos ; s this nonsense about , that won &amp; apos ; t work . i &amp; apos ; m talking about storage .
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &amp; apos ; re rewarded for coming clean .
now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- i give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz &amp; apos ; s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
it &amp; apos ; s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &amp; apos ; s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday . gettin &amp; apos ; down on friday . so you didn &amp; apos ; t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
i would like to jump straight to one of noah &amp; apos ; s original data ##AT##-##AT## sets -- and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and it &amp; apos ; s not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we &amp; apos ; ve put up on the website .
a couple of years ago , the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body .
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &amp; apos ; s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
now let &amp; apos ; s take a step back in time to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto ##AT##-##AT## life , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi ##AT##-##AT## celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years .
it means that a young kid from the andes who &amp; apos ; s raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &amp; quot ; well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &amp; apos ; t we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again ? well that would be awesome . &amp; quot ;
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact , the ipcc report , that &amp; apos ; s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say , &amp; quot ; ok , that isn &amp; apos ; t that big of a deal . &amp; quot ;
and so now you find it in biology , and i &amp; apos ; d like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology , biology is actually an information science because the dna code is an abstract code that yes , it &amp; apos ; s not exactly like a computer , because it &amp; apos ; s more dynamic , because it &amp; apos ; s material , i mean real material , and not just cybernetic .
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &amp; apos ; re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
i once travelled 6,000 miles from chengdu in western china overland through southeastern tibet to l<<unk>> a with a young colleague , and it was only when i got to l<<unk>> a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what frances arnold calls &amp; quot ; directed evolution . &amp; quot ;
and they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said , okay , we can make this easier and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so freely available hardware and electronics and they &amp; apos ; re now the they &amp; apos ; ve now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide .
in the early &amp; apos ; 80s , i had a really astonishing assignment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of duvalier &amp; apos ; s strength and tonton macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ; nanomaterials ; and a.i .
that here is biocurious , the hackerspace i mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology .
and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning , one of the great diy innovators , i &amp; apos ; d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
and the result is -- we call it &amp; quot ; patient autonomy , &amp; quot ; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision ##AT##-##AT## making from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely , the patient .
and so , that would be your response to the bjorn lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &amp; apos ; s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &amp; apos ; s a stupid waste of the earth &amp; apos ; s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
that &amp; apos ; s right , some lucky individual , corporation , for ##AT##-##AT## profit or non ##AT##-##AT## profit , was going to get the once<<unk>> a ##AT##-##AT## lifetime opportunity -- because i &amp; apos ; m sure chris anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you &amp; apos ; re watching right now , that at the time didn &amp; apos ; t have a title , didn &amp; apos ; t really have a lot of content and didn &amp; apos ; t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &amp; quot ; ok , i don &amp; apos ; t care that it doesn &amp; apos ; t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &amp; apos ; ll accept it because it &amp; apos ; s cheaper than what &amp; apos ; s come before . &amp; quot ;
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on dr. p &amp; apos ; s part to get me to do the exercises i didn &amp; apos ; t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five ##AT##-##AT## year ##AT##-##AT## old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
and , to dimensionalize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
if one person said no , there was the veto principle , which was totally demoralising , for ten years , i i had grave doubts as to whether i was perhaps really wasting my great engineering degree on something ridiculous , also because all my father &amp; apos ; s colleagues had told him , you wasted your money on your child .
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you &amp; apos ; ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de<<unk>> friends , these older women , johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia durr , a white woman , whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr. king .
bg : well , we haven &amp; apos ; t picked a particular place , and there &amp; apos ; s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &amp; apos ; s called &amp; quot ; nuclear , &amp; quot ; so we &amp; apos ; ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china -- i &amp; apos ; ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
the human ability to adapt , it &amp; apos ; s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and i &amp; apos ; m going to make an admission : this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people &amp; apos ; s questions about it , and i think i &amp; apos ; m starting to figure out why .
i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who &amp; apos ; s now in her 90s , but she &amp; apos ; s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
now , i &amp; apos ; d like to start with an example of somebody who had a <<unk>> tion ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story -- he said he &amp; apos ; d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
and if i now transfer this , if i let orient take shape as an overview , select as a selection , inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and i can look at in detail , and yes , transact means i can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping , etc . ,
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
and has nothing more to do with reality .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &amp; quot ; eat , pray , love , &amp; quot ; and i fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &amp; apos ; re working on something and it &amp; apos ; s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr . you just type notre dame into flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t ##AT##-##AT## shirts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of huxwh<<unk>> w and the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their hamatsa initiation .
i encourage all of you to read steve &amp; apos ; s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &amp; apos ; ll pardon the pun -- in helping nathaniel get off the streets .
and i wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa advi<<unk>> board , planning actual space missions , going to russia , going through the pre ##AT##-##AT## cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and that was really very , very bitter and then you end up in one of these phases just now you saw that image with don &amp; apos ; t give up written on it , where i asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand deutschmark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the collective of course , whether that was really such a great thing .
we also brought one of these diesel aggregates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here &amp; apos ; s the big battery , here are all the converters , with which we simulate the network .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &amp; apos ; ll never make that mistake again .
so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro <<unk>> itero , we did a study with people at ing -- employees that are all working at ing -- and now these people were all in a session where they &amp; apos ; re doing enrollment for their 401 plan .
you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
i then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so i bought some secondhand equipment on ebay and did a little dna analysis , and tried to do a paternity test , so dna fingerprinting in other words , at home again .
and so with this premises with this premises , brian degger in england , for example , tried to set up a mini ##AT##-##AT## laboratory , took a pressure cooker , a hot plate and , yes , soup stock , and bred bacteria with it , working like this .
and if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you &amp; apos ; ll understand why ninety ##AT##-##AT## nine percent of today &amp; apos ; s software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable , including the ipad in many areas or the iphone , although it &amp; apos ; s already a lot more intuitive than classical software .
the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies -- all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabilized slide ##AT##-##AT## show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
curious historical footnote -- when the moors invaded southern spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from &amp; quot ; allah , allah , allah , &amp; quot ; to &amp; quot ; <<unk>> , <<unk>> , <<unk>> , &amp; quot ; which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &amp; apos ; ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &amp; apos ; t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &amp; apos ; d change the subject and we would move on .
and that &amp; apos ; s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &amp; apos ; re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o &amp; apos ; reilly , &amp; quot ; what we do together that we can &amp; apos ; t do alone . &amp; quot ;
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &amp; apos ; t an mit professor , it wasn &amp; apos ; t a caltech student , it was a person from england , from manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and , at night , was the world &amp; apos ; s best protein folder .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &amp; apos ; s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what i &amp; apos ; d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don &amp; apos ; t count the 10 extra ##AT##-##AT## virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off ##AT##-##AT## chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
firstly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents , your curiosity is of course awakened .
so , i wrote this piece called &amp; quot ; avatar , &amp; quot ; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of cg effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg , and the main characters would all be in cg , and the world would be in cg .
you know , i think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
implicit in this phrase of &amp; quot ; overcoming adversity &amp; quot ; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unsc<<unk>> d or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the <<unk>> ed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
and , as i &amp; apos ; ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &amp; apos ; ve been sort of looking across time , and i &amp; apos ; ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &amp; apos ; s the surgeon that will be chosen .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &amp; apos ; t change .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it &amp; apos ; s over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &amp; apos ; d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &amp; apos ; s studio , kind of like dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
you know , when michelangelo sculpted the moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , <<unk>> ted , &amp; quot ; perché non parli ? why don &amp; apos ; t you talk ? &amp; quot ;
i probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , i probably belong to the generation that created this bad ecological image , because i already started to study engineering at the technical university in karlsruhe in nineteen sev<<unk>> nine , i think it &amp; apos ; s called kit today .
and i know there &amp; apos ; s some of you who say , &amp; quot ; well , wouldn &amp; apos ; t it be better , wouldn &amp; apos ; t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &amp; quot ; and i say , &amp; quot ; great , let &amp; apos ; s make that language yor<<unk>> . let &amp; apos ; s make it cantonese .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
he was speaking in a very jo<<unk>> and greg<<unk>> way about yo ##AT##-##AT## yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers were never going to make the world series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of beethoven &amp; apos ; s fourth symphony .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i &amp; apos ; ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &amp; apos ; s call center , as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
we &amp; apos ; re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet i actually think we &amp; apos ; d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
what i &amp; apos ; m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is seadragon , and it &amp; apos ; s an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multip<<unk>> : so , you &amp; apos ; ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &amp; apos ; s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &amp; apos ; s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &amp; apos ; ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &amp; quot ; white coat , black art . &amp; quot ;
so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &amp; apos ; s a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that &amp; apos ; s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &amp; apos ; s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organised two events , one in london , in two thousand ten , and shortly after that in the usa , in san francisco .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing , but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &amp; apos ; s actuating our environment .
a group from ankara , that i came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain dna to people .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &amp; apos ; re at fault .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &amp; quot ; well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &amp; apos ; s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &amp; apos ; t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &amp; apos ; s only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i &amp; apos ; d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &amp; apos ; t leave a trace .
but we don &amp; apos ; t even blink when we hear somebody say this because we &amp; apos ; ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &amp; apos ; ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
but in fact , what we &amp; apos ; re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &amp; apos ; s an increase in sales , there &amp; apos ; s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything -- i hated them , had names for them . i hated them .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &amp; apos ; real &amp; apos ; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &amp; quot ; something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &amp; quot ;
and when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why offenbach , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty , right ?
and they will get healthier by using the tricorder , and they &amp; apos ; ll become better educated by using the khan academy , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing &amp; # 91 ; become &amp; # 93 ; more productive than ever before .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite i have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
because we want this self ##AT##-##AT## deception , this feeling of being brilliant , descended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that &amp; apos ; s unbearable for us .
so you see these astonishing demonstrations : voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the fresh prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like errol flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like gandalf .
and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung <<unk>> b -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
that really works , it &amp; apos ; s done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a webcam , dismantled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold <<unk>> ation approximately .
in this picture , i &amp; apos ; ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but i &amp; apos ; d just gotten past &amp; quot ; mangled , &amp; quot ; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
so , that &amp; apos ; s probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so i &amp; apos ; ll say it again , let it sink in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
we don &amp; apos ; t have a situation that iran has , for example , where a man who &amp; apos ; s sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he &amp; apos ; s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &amp; apos ; s allowed to live .
so what happens in &amp; quot ; the greatest movie ever sold , &amp; quot ; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is branded from beginning to end -- from the above ##AT##-##AT## the ##AT##-##AT## title sponsor that you &amp; apos ; ll see in the movie , which is brand x .
the greatest car you ever drove from &amp; quot ; the greatest movie ever sold , &amp; quot ; the greatest drink you &amp; apos ; ve ever had , courtesy of &amp; quot ; the greatest movie ever sold . &amp; quot ;
and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post ##AT##-##AT## human futures that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
the great 20th ##AT##-##AT## century geneticist , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay that he titled &amp; quot ; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &amp; quot ;
the neolithic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
and a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of posing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better .
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &amp; apos ; s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &amp; quot ; how have you been feeling lately ? &amp; quot ;
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &amp; quot ; wow . aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &amp; apos ; re going to break one of those bands .
and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this memoir called &amp; quot ; eat , pray , love &amp; quot ; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega ##AT##-##AT## sensation , international bestseller thing .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &amp; apos ; t have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &amp; apos ; t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
the nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate biogas , on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it , raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish .
whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke rousseau and the old canard of the &amp; quot ; noble savage , &amp; quot ; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke thoreau and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
bil gates : to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &amp; apos ; ve done , that &amp; apos ; s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &amp; apos ; ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
imagination is more important than knowledge , and i &amp; apos ; d like to close on that sentence a and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions , and so i thank you war<<unk>> for your attention and please .
those are it has a more arty character , so it &amp; apos ; s many artists and philosophers are working , together with scientists , on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively , there are museum exhibitions and , well , all sorts of things .
so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
later that day , i was driving around this property with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &amp; quot ; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &amp; apos ; d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &amp; quot ;
and we simulated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fifty cents per kwh after twenty years , you &amp; apos ; d arrive at about forty ##AT##-##AT## four cents .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &amp; apos ; s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &amp; apos ; m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &amp; apos ; s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &amp; apos ; s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
there &amp; apos ; s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub ##AT##-##AT## saharan africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
we &amp; apos ; ve been working with roberto bolle , one of today &amp; apos ; s top ballet dancers -- the étoile at metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3d in order to use it as an input for flyfire .
most companies tend to -- and it &amp; apos ; s human nature -- to avoid things that they &amp; apos ; re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &amp; apos ; s a neat thing to see .
with its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking : don &amp; apos ; t say that there &amp; apos ; s now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena , because i want to cover that up and not confess to it .
and he &amp; apos ; s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it &amp; apos ; s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , i was doing some nepo<<unk>> searching , looking for bing , over here for live labs pivot .
here it kind of looks like he &amp; apos ; s looking for a date , but what he &amp; apos ; s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &amp; apos ; s not very good at fighting fires when he &amp; apos ; s covered in four feet of snow .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &amp; quot ; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &amp; apos ; re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &amp; apos ; s history after 9 / 11 . &amp; quot ;
this is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they &amp; apos ; re then trapped in there , so it &amp; apos ; s basically like a tractor beam .
another example : a few years ago i got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
we have this bucket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach out to that i didn &amp; apos ; t , all the fences i wanted to mend , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never did .
when we look at its metabolic map , it &amp; apos ; s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &amp; apos ; s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these co2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long ##AT##-##AT## term issue .
now i &amp; apos ; m going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman , emir kamenica , wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &amp; apos ; t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and intersex and female and intersex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced .
then came the next ones , which already worked with a neural model or mental model , as software ergonomists say , because you &amp; apos ; d have a conception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras .
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &amp; apos ; s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
we traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don &amp; apos ; t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &amp; apos ; t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
and against that background , within the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the i mean in the relationship between humans and computers , i looked into how our tools , or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant .
well , they took , over a three ##AT##-##AT## month period , d ##AT##-##AT## level students , gave them a &amp; apos ; s , told them they were &amp; quot ; a &amp; apos ; s , &amp; quot ; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three ##AT##-##AT## month period , they were performing at a ##AT##-##AT## level .
and our aim was , we wanted to reach sev<<unk>> to ninety percent renewable energies and then this remainder is still here , the last remainder , the last ten , twenty percent renewable energies with , that will will be very , very expensive and generating this from batteries won &amp; apos ; t work either .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises , <<unk>> ds , vinegars , jams , but we can &amp; apos ; t actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display .
in this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us <<unk>> thetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown los angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , juilliard ##AT##-##AT## trained musician .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of un<<unk>> able creative impulses that were totally internalized .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &amp; quot ; if we &amp; apos ; re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &amp; quot ;
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
so , not just a farm that doesn &amp; apos ; t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &amp; apos ; s literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
in fact , most of my career , i &amp; apos ; ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &amp; apos ; s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &amp; apos ; s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
if you sum up the co2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &amp; apos ; t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &amp; apos ; s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &amp; apos ; s approach , this looks like it would work .
and other times she wouldn &amp; apos ; t be fast enough , so she &amp; apos ; d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &amp; apos ; t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &amp; quot ; for another poet . &amp; quot ;
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
tan le , anonymous footscray resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
and dr. kean went on to tell me , he said , &amp; quot ; in my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &amp; quot ;
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
so what you were getting was this : your name here presents : my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &amp; apos ; d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the <<unk>> dics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don &amp; apos ; t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &amp; apos ; t talk about it with your colleagues .
and you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &amp; apos ; t in school i was out in the woods , hiking and taking &amp; quot ; samples &amp; quot ; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &amp; apos ; t understand why people thought this was &amp; quot ; frankenfoods , &amp; quot ; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &amp; apos ; s ground .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &amp; apos ; re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &amp; apos ; t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
and there you see that , that people a our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven officially <<unk>> ised senses , and in the near future the next , the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again .
and since then , i &amp; apos ; ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the ctos of the fortune 50 , and there &amp; apos ; s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &amp; apos ; d like to share some of them with you .
there are technical concepts such as <<unk>> augmented reality <<unk>> .
and if i go a step further in these natural user interfaces , where i can control things via voice , speech , touch and gesture rather than a mouse and cursor , then i am even faster and more immediate .
now what this thing does is it inter<<unk>> ts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
we think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &amp; quot ; ta ##AT##-##AT## da &amp; quot ; turns into an &amp; quot ; uh ##AT##-##AT## oh , &amp; quot ; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
you &amp; apos ; re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
and when i think about that , i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i &amp; apos ; ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vacations .
at the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous ##AT##-##AT## vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them .
i mean , they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical &amp; quot ; 1776 &amp; quot ; every few years , and it &amp; apos ; s not because of the music , which is totally forgettable .
i &amp; apos ; m not sure that &amp; apos ; s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &amp; apos ; s now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
and i think that there &amp; apos ; s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &amp; apos ; m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
because i don &amp; apos ; t care if it &amp; apos ; s the secretary of hhs who &amp; apos ; s saying , &amp; quot ; hmm , i &amp; apos ; m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , &amp; quot ; or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee <<unk>> as .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off , and you have the remembering self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience .
henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although i haven &amp; apos ; t told you that he &amp; apos ; s the xy one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be dra<<unk>> , which mary does not need to worry about .
and then the founder of do ##AT##-##AT## it ##AT##-##AT## <<unk>> self ##AT##-##AT## bio dot org came and said : okay
there are other services like how we make fertilizer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for improvement are far , far less .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud .
so this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty ##AT##-##AT## five ##AT##-##AT## thirty percent excess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun .
and then i stuck to it until nineteen ninety six and then i became the co ##AT##-##AT## founder of the company solon together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufacturers in the world together with the spin ##AT##-##AT## off q ##AT##-##AT## cells .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
and it &amp; apos ; s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad ##AT##-##AT## fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who &amp; apos ; s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
i also want to point out that i &amp; apos ; m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know .
i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i &amp; apos ; m writing anything , but i &amp; apos ; d already finished editing the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &amp; quot ; disabled &amp; quot ; to see what i &amp; apos ; d find .
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &amp; apos ; s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &amp; apos ; s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
he said to me , &amp; quot ; i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &amp; apos ; ve been making <<unk>> out of me ever since . &amp; quot ;
what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
but always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
we look into this network , see the fifty hertz , and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz , we start to open a few small valves , then a little more steam can enter , and then it goes up again .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
what if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
this is was the problem : transparency -- free from <<unk>> se or <<unk>> it ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
for example , the anecdote that some present , as captain so ##AT##-##AT## and ##AT##-##AT## so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &amp; apos ; s not &amp; quot ; scientific . &amp; quot ;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &amp; quot ; i came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &amp; quot ;
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &amp; apos ; re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
and these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &amp; quot ; they demolished the building . &amp; quot ;
to finish , i brought along , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final bachelor &amp; apos ; s projects by michael burk , ann ##AT##-##AT## kathrin krenz , joris klause and jan ##AT##-##AT## moritz müller .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- mendelssohn , tchaikovsky , sibelius .
so , she &amp; apos ; s running to the house and she &amp; apos ; s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &amp; apos ; s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
i committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- i &amp; apos ; m like , &amp; quot ; all right , here &amp; apos ; s the deal : tony &amp; apos ; s going to speak , we &amp; apos ; re going to get him a machine , and we &amp; apos ; re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
and if i then place a half oval next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another .
and it &amp; apos ; s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &amp; apos ; s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need <<unk>> logic support or something like it , but also looking backward .
i don &amp; apos ; t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if i put a little love in my heart and look .
something interesting came out of &amp; quot ; the abyss , &amp; quot ; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , cg .
and then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes .
and this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transports you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our archaic roots .
now , the fascinating things are that the beta ##AT##-##AT## <<unk>> olines found within that liana are mao inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the <<unk>> ptamine . so you ask yourself a question .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we &amp; apos ; ve built recently , in which siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
i think that interactive media address archaic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10 worst ##AT##-##AT## selling cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , <<unk>> video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &amp; apos ; s not , and that &amp; apos ; s to take all the co2 , after you &amp; apos ; ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i &amp; apos ; ve come to have increasing doubts .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic <<unk>> des , the worst of which can manifest themselves as and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of skid row , exposed to its hor<<unk>> , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
so when i now that &amp; apos ; s what the what profilers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair samples , and then they make these implement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like that .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &amp; apos ; s a very large sample of americans , like 600,000 , so it &amp; apos ; s a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
i mean , when i &amp; apos ; m in an elevator all alone , i do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and i stop doing those things because i don &amp; apos ; t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them .
i &amp; apos ; m glad to say we don &amp; apos ; t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon i talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them , partly to make a name for himself .
in order to get target theories , we remember that it &amp; apos ; s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high ##AT##-##AT## value target and it is most likely located in iran , because that &amp; apos ; s where most of the infections had been reported .
everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can &amp; apos ; t just simply render a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful translation can occur .
we took a ps3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an led light , and now there &amp; apos ; s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
i &amp; apos ; m a designer from birth , so of course i deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn transforms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a jolt et cetera .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
i met these guys called grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space .
and what we know from cross ##AT##-##AT## cultural studies is that females , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on moore &amp; apos ; s law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &amp; apos ; t need .
that was a massive outcry at the time , because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing , meaning that i took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it .
in spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &amp; quot ; allah , <<unk>> , <<unk>> , allah , magnificent , bravo , &amp; quot ; incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of god .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
that means i &amp; apos ; ve corrupted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and i &amp; apos ; ve conditioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this obscure image .
so , we &amp; apos ; ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem ##AT##-##AT## solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an epic win .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &amp; apos ; s dwarfism , or it &amp; apos ; s conjoined tw<<unk>> , or it &amp; apos ; s an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
it &amp; apos ; s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &amp; apos ; t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &amp; apos ; re afraid , is really very deadening , and it &amp; apos ; s preventing millions of people from prospering .
now if you take this picture -- i &amp; apos ; m italian originally , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason i &amp; apos ; m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people &amp; apos ; s way of life , is not only not condemned , it &amp; apos ; s universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
that means we feel so guilty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no <<unk>> and , no nature ##AT##-##AT## et ##AT##-##AT## <<unk>> ès or whatever they &amp; apos ; re all called , that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle .
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cellulose base , you &amp; apos ; ll be able to plant one hundred and fifty trees in israel or tunisia with one baby .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teenager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of fear ##AT##-##AT## based reaction .
i became enamored of the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single ##AT##-##AT## celled organisms , each cell simply divides , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells .
they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &amp; apos ; re using mri &amp; apos ; s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing .
if you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determined by the larger haystack that immediately attracts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories : &amp; quot ; terminator , &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; aliens &amp; quot ; and &amp; quot ; the abyss . &amp; quot ;
immediately after that vote , on february 21st to the 24th , a delegation of about 30 hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of baffin island when i went narwhal hunting with some inuit people , and this man , olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , cd player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
i study molecular biology and have been doing research into biohacking for a few years now , i started doing this because i simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what i &amp; apos ; d learned theoretically into practice .
and then finally , just as they &amp; apos ; re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta ##AT##-##AT## da ! -- they admire their work .
and now i &amp; apos ; ll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today i &amp; apos ; m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
that was also an affront at the time , where the gentry , clergymen and others said : have you gone mad , if the people start to read , they &amp; apos ; ll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &amp; apos ; t get used for weapons .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &amp; quot ; if you see an aed , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &amp; apos ; s open , &amp; quot ; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &amp; apos ; s closed , of course .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &amp; apos ; t be judged by our design , we won &amp; apos ; t be judged by our intellect and reason .
i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
simply by virtue of the fact that mary was born prematurely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co2 as its feedstock , and so we &amp; apos ; re working with designing cells to go down this road .
the spirits can be invoked from beneath the great water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily <<unk>> ace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
that means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same cave or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this tribal society .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &amp; apos ; s everything from cell phone cameras to professional slrs , quite a large number of them , stitched together in this environment .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low ##AT##-##AT## level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they <<unk>> mized .
the the question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are drilled out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they &amp; apos ; re an island .
then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &amp; apos ; t trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &amp; apos ; s good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions .
but that &amp; apos ; s my my prototype , which looked pretty wild though , on a branch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &amp; apos ; d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
and , because i was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
i &amp; apos ; m a historian by training , and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with <<unk>> ly fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high ##AT##-##AT## risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
there is adversity and challenge in life , and it &amp; apos ; s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &amp; apos ; t whether or not you &amp; apos ; re going to meet adversity , but how you &amp; apos ; re going to meet it .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
and when we &amp; apos ; re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &amp; apos ; s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
we can see that here , when i design things , then i can design them in a confusing way , as you can see here on the right , where i can &amp; apos ; t tell which one is salt and which one is pepper , or i can basically design them intuitively , by showing things .
aren &amp; apos ; t you afraid that you &amp; apos ; re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &amp; apos ; s ever going to come of it and you &amp; apos ; re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &amp; quot ;
bg : that &amp; apos ; s right . today , you &amp; apos ; re always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong : that thing where you &amp; apos ; re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &amp; apos ; s not good .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &amp; apos ; s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the penan -- a nomadic people from southeast asia , from sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of borneo away to the south china sea , where the japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the yanomami , it &amp; apos ; s the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
the oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &amp; apos ; s real , and to live your real life as if we &amp; apos ; ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real ##AT##-##AT## time news , videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &amp; apos ; s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the <<unk>> ation of it . it &amp; apos ; s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta ##AT##-##AT## <<unk>> olines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &amp; apos ; s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called psychotria viridis .
just to know that jaguar shamans still journey beyond the milky way , or the myths of the inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the <<unk>> aya , the buddhists still pursue the breath of the dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
and whether it is the penan in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya , the curandero in the mountains of the andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that i traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of qomolangma , everest , the goddess mother of the world .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip <<unk>> ements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self ##AT##-##AT## identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
